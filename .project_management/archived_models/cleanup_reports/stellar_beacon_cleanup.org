* Session Summary
** Objective
   Set up skeleton structure for new Content Extractor sub-project focused on human-in-the-loop HTML content analysis and selector generation
   - Goal: Create comprehensive Django app foundation with detailed implementation plan
   - Target: Transition from archived historical work to new development focus
   - Priority: Establish clear roadmap for future models to implement system

** Key Accomplishments
   - ✅ Successfully archived 14 historical models (Silver Mongoose through Quiet Forge)
   - ✅ Created new Django app: `apps/content_extractor/` with complete structure
   - ✅ Designed comprehensive data models for extraction projects and selectors
   - ✅ Created detailed 5-phase implementation plan with effort estimates
   - ✅ Updated active work tracking to focus on new sub-project
   - ✅ Established clear handoff documentation for seamless continuation

** Major Changes Made
*** Archive Operation
    - Created `.old_model_files/` directory structure
    - Moved 41 files: 14 conversation logs + 14 cleanup reports + 13 next steps
    - Preserved chronological organization while cleaning active workspace

*** Content Extractor App Structure  
    - Django app: `apps/content_extractor/` with proper configuration
    - Models: ExtractionProject, AnalyzedPage, ContentSelector, SelectionSession
    - Admin configuration: Full admin interface for all models
    - Directory structure: extractors/, selectors/, utils/, management/commands/

*** Implementation Framework
    - **Phase 1**: HTML Processing Foundation (2-4 model sessions)
    - **Phase 2**: Human-in-the-Loop Selection System (7-9 model sessions)  
    - **Phase 3**: Pattern Analysis and Generalization (5-7 model sessions)
    - **Phase 4**: Django Integration and Management (5-7 model sessions)
    - **Phase 5**: Testing and Optimization (3-5 model sessions)

** Environment Status
   - ✅ Clean workspace with streamlined cursor rules ready for optimal performance
   - ✅ New app structure created and documented
   - ✅ Models designed with proper relationships and validation
   - ✅ Implementation plan provides clear roadmap for 20-30 model sessions
   - ✅ All placeholder files created with descriptive documentation

** Files Modified (Complete List)
*** Archive Files Created
   - `.old_model_files/` - Complete archive directory structure

*** Content Extractor App Files
   - `apps/content_extractor/__init__.py` - App metadata and documentation
   - `apps/content_extractor/apps.py` - Django app configuration  
   - `apps/content_extractor/models.py` - Complete data model design (136 lines)
   - `apps/content_extractor/admin.py` - Admin interface configuration
   - `apps/content_extractor/extractors/html_processor.py` - HTML processing placeholder
   - `apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py` - Selenium interface placeholder
   - `apps/content_extractor/selectors/pattern_generalizer.py` - Pattern analysis placeholder
   - `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/start_extraction_project.py` - Management command placeholder

*** Project Management Updates
   - `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org` - Complete rewrite with implementation plan
   - `.project_management/conversation_logs/stellar-beacon/2025-01-08_session_log.org` - Session documentation
   - `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org` - Added Stellar Beacon entry

** Architecture Design
*** Database Schema
   - **ExtractionProject**: Central project management with status tracking
   - **AnalyzedPage**: HTML storage with processed JSON representation
   - **ContentSelector**: XPath/CSS selectors with confidence scoring
   - **SelectionSession**: Human selection session state management

*** Technical Approach
   - **Human-in-the-Loop**: Selenium + custom JavaScript for content selection
   - **Robust Selectors**: XPath generation with fallback chains and pattern generalization
   - **Cross-Page Validation**: Confidence scoring and content consistency checking
   - **Django Integration**: Management commands + admin interface + optional web UI

** Current Status: SKELETON COMPLETE
   - ✅ App structure fully established with logical organization
   - ✅ Data models designed for complete workflow support
   - ✅ Implementation plan provides clear direction for 5 phases
   - ✅ Dependencies identified: selenium, beautifulsoup4, lxml, webdriver-manager
   - ✅ Ready for Phase 1 implementation (HTML processing foundation)

** Next Model Recommendations
*** Immediate Priority
   1. **Add app to Django settings** and create initial migrations
   2. **Implement Phase 1.1**: HTML to JSON converter in `html_processor.py`
   3. **Install dependencies**: selenium, beautifulsoup4, lxml, webdriver-manager

*** Development Approach
   - Focus on Phase 1 (HTML Processing) before moving to human interface
   - Build incrementally with testing at each step
   - Use management commands for workflow orchestration
   - Test with real websites early to validate approach

** Success Metrics
   - Target: Complete app skeleton with implementation plan → ✅ ACHIEVED
   - Validation: Clear roadmap for future development → ✅ ACHIEVED
   - Outcome: Seamless handoff to implementation phase → ✅ READY

** Project Health: EXCELLENT
   - Clear vision and technical approach established
   - Comprehensive implementation plan with realistic effort estimates
   - Strong foundation for human-in-the-loop content extraction system
   - Ready for focused development with streamlined cursor rules
