* EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Mission Completed**: Successfully synthesized user's strategic direction by integrating the proven working `test_nested_selector` system with AI-focused model storage using long text fields for AI classification.

**Key Achievement**: Complete system alignment while preserving sophisticated nested selection capabilities.

**Critical Gap Identified**: Admin panel interface for AIPreparationRecord model is missing.

* STRATEGIC DIRECTION IMPLEMENTED

** User Guidance Synthesized ‚úÖ
- **User Request**: "Continue with test_nested_selector but tie to new model with long text fields for AI classification"
- **Approach**: Kept working nested selector interface, redirected all storage to AI preparation model
- **Result**: Perfect synthesis of Swift Falcon's proven functionality with AI-focused requirements

** Technical Strategy ‚úÖ 
- Preserved all sophisticated selection capabilities (11 field types, 3-level nesting)
- Redirected data storage from SiteFieldSelector to AIPreparationRecord model
- Enhanced with AI context collection (user comments, confidence levels, content types)
- Maintained session-based organization for AI processing workflow

* MAJOR CHANGES IMPLEMENTED
