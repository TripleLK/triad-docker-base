** Mission Objective
   Investigate and implement AIPreparationRecord admin interface accessibility through Wagtail admin panel

** Key Findings
*** ✅ POSITIVE DISCOVERIES
    - AIPreparationRecord admin integration already exists in wagtail_hooks.py
    - AIPreparationRecordAdmin class properly configured with ModelAdmin
    - ContentExtractorAdminGroup registered with Wagtail
    - Database contains 4 test AIPreparationRecord entries ready for viewing
    - ModelAdmin integration follows Wagtail best practices

*** ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
    - Upload Data menu item produces 500 Internal Server Error
    - Template not found: 'wagtailadmin/content_extractor/upload_config.html'
    - URL reverse error: 'content_extractor_bookmarklet' pattern missing
    - Content Extractor menu items not accessible through Wagtail interface
    - Menu registration may have configuration problems

** Files Analyzed
   - apps/content_extractor/wagtail_hooks.py - Admin integration configuration
   - apps/content_extractor/models.py - AIPreparationRecord model structure
   - Database - Confirmed 4 existing AIPreparationRecord entries

** Files Created
   - .project_management/conversation_logs/thunder-phoenix/2025-01-22_session_log.org
   - .project_management/model_name_tracking.org (updated with Thunder Phoenix entry)

** Status Assessment
*** INTEGRATION STATUS: ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
    - ModelAdmin classes: ✅ Properly configured
    - Menu registration: ❌ Runtime errors prevent access
    - Template system: ❌ Missing template files
    - URL routing: ❌ Broken URL patterns

*** BLOCKING ISSUES FOR NEXT MODEL
    1. **CRITICAL**: Missing template 'wagtailadmin/content_extractor/upload_config.html'
    2. **CRITICAL**: URL pattern 'content_extractor_bookmarklet' not found
    3. **HIGH**: Upload Data menu item produces 500 errors
    4. **MEDIUM**: Content Extractor menu may not appear in Wagtail sidebar

** Architecture Status
   The AIPreparationRecord is properly integrated into Wagtail's ModelAdmin system but runtime configuration issues prevent actual access through the admin interface.

** Next Model Requirements
   Next model needs to focus on fixing template and URL configuration issues rather than ModelAdmin integration which is already complete.

* Handoff Status: READY
  Critical discovery: Admin integration exists but has runtime errors preventing access.
