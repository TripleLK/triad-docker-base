* Summary
** What Was Accomplished
- Conducted comprehensive feasibility analysis for moving content extractor to Wagtail interface
- Identified critical server deployment limitation with current Selenium approach
- Proposed bookmarklet architecture as viable solution
- Analyzed technical blockers including cross-origin policies, iframe limitations, and headless browser issues

** Major Decisions
- **STRATEGIC PIVOT**: Recommended bookmarklet approach over Wagtail iframe integration
- **ARCHITECTURE SHIFT**: From server-side Selenium to client-side JavaScript execution
- **FILE WORKFLOW**: Save/load pattern for bridging user selection to Wagtail admin

* Files Modified/Created
** Created Files
- `.project_management/cleanup_reports/thunder-nexus_cleanup.org` - This cleanup report
- `.project_management/next_steps/thunder-nexus_next_steps.org` - Implementation roadmap

** Updated Files  
- `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org` - Added Thunder Nexus entry

* Reasoning
** Why Bookmarklet Architecture
1. **Solves Server Deployment Issue**: Runs in user's browser, not server
2. **No Cross-Origin Restrictions**: Executes in context of target website
3. **Maintains Interactive Selection**: User can see and interact with elements
4. **Wagtail Integration Viable**: File upload/management fits Wagtail admin perfectly

** Technical Analysis
- Current Selenium approach fundamentally incompatible with server deployment
- Iframe blocked by X-Frame-Options and CSP headers on most websites
- Headless mode breaks interactive selection completely
- Bookmarklet provides clean separation of concerns

* Architecture Changes
** Proposed New Structure
```
User Browser (Bookmarklet) → Local Save → Wagtail Admin Upload → Server Processing
```

** Components Needed
1. **Bookmarklet**: JavaScript injection for element selection
2. **Export Function**: Save selection config as JSON/file
3. **Wagtail Admin Panel**: File upload and management interface
4. **Processing Backend**: Load saved configs for content extraction

* Issues and Concerns
** Technical Challenges
- Bookmarklet JavaScript complexity for element selection UI
- Cross-browser compatibility requirements
- File save/load workflow UX design
- Integration with existing Django models

** Security Considerations
- Bookmarklet code injection safety
- File upload validation in Wagtail
- Sanitization of user-generated selection configs

* Verification Performed
- Analyzed existing Wagtail hooks and admin integration patterns
- Reviewed content extractor architecture and Selenium implementation
- Examined JavaScript injection mechanisms and browser security policies
- Assessed server deployment constraints and headless browser limitations

* Context and References
** Related Documentation
- Conversation logs: `.project_management/conversation_logs/quantum-blazer/2025-01-22_session_log.org`
- Previous analysis of menu unification and XPath editor integration
- Server deployment feasibility investigation

** Key Insights
- Original Wagtail integration assessment was overly optimistic
- Server-side browser automation incompatible with web-based UI
- Bookmarklet approach aligns with modern web app architecture patterns
