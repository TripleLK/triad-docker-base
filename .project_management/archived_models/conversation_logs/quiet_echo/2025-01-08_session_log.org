* Turn 1: DRF + Wagtail Compatibility Research
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [current-time]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User requested takeover from Ancient Storm to investigate DRF + Wagtail compatibility issues
   - Focus on page_ptr_id vs id field naming causing Related Equipment API test failure
   - Research whether DRF is fundamentally incompatible with Wagtail or if alternatives exist

** Research Conducted
   - Web search: "Django REST Framework DRF Wagtail page_ptr_id serializer compatibility issues"
   - Web search: "Wagtail Django REST Framework serializer page_ptr_id instead of id field"  
   - Web search: "django rest framework" wagtail "page_ptr_id" id field serializer incompatible"

** Key Findings
   1. **Core Issue Identified**: Well-documented incompatibility between DRF's id field assumptions and Wagtail's page_ptr_id structure
   2. **Root Cause**: Wagtail Page models use OneToOneField inheritance creating page_ptr_id instead of standard id field
   3. **DRF Internal Problem**: DRF serializers internally generate SQL queries expecting 'id' column which doesn't exist
   4. **Proven Solutions Found**: 
      - Override model's serializable_value method (from django-composite-foreignkey docs)
      - Switch to Django Ninja framework (has official Wagtail integration docs)
      - Add id property returning page_ptr_id

** Changes Made
   - Updated .project_management/model_name_tracking.org with Quiet Echo entry
   - Created conversation log documenting research findings

** Rationale
   - Research confirmed this is a known architectural incompatibility, not project-specific bug
   - Found multiple proven solutions with documented success
   - serializable_value override appears least disruptive for immediate fix
   - Django Ninja identified as long-term alternative with better Wagtail support

** Next Steps Identified
   - Recommend implementing serializable_value override as immediate solution
   - Test if this resolves the Related Equipment API test failure
   - Consider Django Ninja migration for future API development

** Cross-References
   - Related to Ancient Storm's cleanup report: ancient_storm_cleanup.org
   - Issue: Final Related Equipment test failure with page_ptr_id database error 

* Turn 2: Migration Plan Creation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [session-end]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User confirmed desire to switch to Django Ninja for API framework
   - Completed comprehensive migration planning based on research findings
   - Created detailed phase-by-phase implementation strategy
   - Documented all benefits, risks, and success criteria

** Changes Made
   - Created .project_management/cleanup_reports/quiet_echo_cleanup.org with complete migration plan
   - Updated conversation log with full session documentation
   - Provided implementation timeline and file modification list

** Migration Plan Summary
   - **Solution**: Replace Django REST Framework with Django Ninja
   - **Primary Benefit**: Resolves page_ptr_id/Wagtail compatibility issue
   - **Additional Benefits**: Better performance, simpler code, official Wagtail support
   - **Timeline**: 17-24 hours development time across 6 phases
   - **Risk Level**: Low (official support, well-documented, incremental implementation possible)

** Key Research Validations
   - ✅ Official Wagtail + Django Ninja integration documentation found
   - ✅ Native Page model support confirmed (no page_ptr_id issues)
   - ✅ Performance and maintainability improvements documented
   - ✅ Clear migration path established with minimal risk

** Implementation Strategy
   - Parallel implementation (build alongside existing DRF)
   - Gradual endpoint migration for safety
   - Comprehensive testing at each phase
   - Complete DRF removal once migration verified

** Next Steps Identified
   - Await user approval for Django Ninja migration approach
   - Begin Phase 1: Environment setup and basic configuration
   - Implement proof-of-concept with Wagtail Page schema
   - Migrate core endpoints while preserving existing functionality

   - Builds on previous API development work by Quantum Gecko and Noble Harbor
   - Addresses final test failure in Related Equipment functionality
