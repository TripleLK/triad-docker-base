* Turn 1: Handoff from Quantum Catalyst - CSS Emergency Fix
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 10:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- Taking over from Quantum Catalyst with CRITICAL CSS interference issue
- Field selection menu implementation is complete but UI elements are invisible/unreadable
- Site CSS overriding content extractor styles with white text and wrong sizing
- Must fix CSS specificity and add !important declarations IMMEDIATELY
- Ready for multi-value generalization after CSS resolution

** Immediate Action Plan
1. CRITICAL: Fix CSS interference in interactive_selector.py
2. Add !important declarations to all UI styles
3. Increase CSS specificity for better override capability
4. Test on airscience.com URLs after fixes
5. Proceed with multi-value field generalization

** Changes Made
- Updated model_name_tracking.org with Stellar Dynamo entry
- Created conversation log directory and initial log

** Rationale
- CSS visibility is blocking all further development
- Field selection infrastructure is complete but unusable due to styling issues
- Must resolve immediately before proceeding with next features

** Next Steps Identified
- Fix CSS interference in interactive_selector.py (CRITICAL)
- Test UI visibility on various sites
- Implement multi-value field generalization algorithm
- Enhance database storage integration

* Turn 2: CSS Fixes and Testing Issues Discovery
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 10:45:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- Successfully implemented comprehensive CSS fixes with !important declarations
- Added !important to all critical UI elements: badges, menu, buttons, overlays, toggles
- Fixed CSS specificity issues preventing site CSS from overriding content extractor styles
- Discovered testing revealed two critical issues: JavaScript function loading and URL validation

** Changes Made
- apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py: Added !important to all CSS styles
  - Badge styling (lines ~185)
  - Field selection menu (lines ~230)
  - Button styles (lines ~320)
  - Toggle button (lines ~520)
  - Instruction overlay (lines ~770)
  - Progress section (lines ~400)
  - All inline HTML styles throughout

** Issues Discovered During Testing
1. JavaScript Function Loading: window.getFieldSelections not available after page load
2. URL Validation: 404 error on specific product pages, need working URLs
3. Selection Interface: User reports no selection capability despite CSS fixes

** Rationale
- CSS interference was causing complete UI invisibility
- !important declarations ensure content extractor styles override site CSS
- Testing revealed deeper JavaScript injection/persistence issues requiring next model attention

** Next Steps Identified
- CRITICAL: Fix JavaScript function injection after page load
- Find and validate working test URLs 
- Test actual selection functionality with working JavaScript
- Proceed with multi-value generalization after core functionality confirmed
