* Turn 1: JavaScript Interface Updates for Enhanced Features
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [12:30:00]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Taking over from Cosmic Forge handoff. Backend implementation is complete for both:
- Miscellaneous field with notes functionality (multi-value-notes type)
- Add instance functionality for nested objects (add-instance type)

Need to complete JavaScript interface updates in interactive_selector.py to make these features functional.

** Changes Made
About to implement the required JavaScript handlers for new field types.

** Rationale
The backend logic is solid but the JavaScript interface needs updating to handle the new field types properly and integrate with the existing menu system.

** Next Steps Identified
1. Add field type grouping for multi-value-notes and add-instance types
2. Add click handlers for these field types
3. Add JavaScript support for notes prompting
4. Test on target URL

* Turn 2: Initial Handoff Processing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Session Start]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - Received handoff from Quiet Forge with explicit instructions to archive old model files
   - User clarified the goal: set up new sub-project for HTML content extraction system
   - Focus on human-in-the-loop approach for identifying unique content and generating selectors
   - Established need for Django app structure rather than immediate implementation

** Changes Made 
   - Successfully archived 14 historical models (Silver Mongoose through Quiet Forge)
   - Created `.old_model_files/` structure with 41 files moved chronologically
   - Cleaned active workspace while preserving all historical context

** Rationale
   - Following explicit handoff instructions to archive before starting new work
   - Maintaining clean workspace for optimal development with streamlined cursor rules
   - Preserving historical context in organized manner for future reference

* Turn 3: Content Extractor System Planning
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Mid-session]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User introduced comprehensive vision for HTML content extraction system
   - Discussed 3-step original plan: HTML→JSON, cross-page analysis, pattern generalization
   - Refined approach through discussion of technical challenges and alternatives
   - Settled on human-in-the-loop approach using Selenium + custom JavaScript interface

** Technical Architecture Discussed
   - **Phase 1**: HTML processing foundation with simplified JSON DOM
   - **Phase 2**: Human selection interface with Selenium and custom UI
   - **Phase 3**: Pattern analysis and selector generalization
   - **Phase 4**: Django integration with management commands
   - **Phase 5**: Testing and optimization for production use

** Key Insights
   - Human selection more reliable than algorithmic boilerplate detection
   - XPath selectors preferred over CSS for robustness
   - Cross-page validation essential for selector confidence scoring
   - Need session management for resumable human selection process

* Turn 4: Django App Structure Creation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Implementation phase]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - Created complete Django app: `apps/content_extractor/`
   - Designed comprehensive data models for extraction workflow
   - Set up directory structure for logical component organization
   - Created placeholder files with descriptive documentation

** Changes Made
   - **Django App Files**:
     - `apps/content_extractor/__init__.py` - App metadata (14 lines)
     - `apps/content_extractor/apps.py` - Django configuration (13 lines)
     - `apps/content_extractor/models.py` - Complete data models (136 lines)
     - `apps/content_extractor/admin.py` - Admin interface configuration (26 lines)

   - **Component Placeholders**:
     - `apps/content_extractor/extractors/html_processor.py` - HTML processing placeholder
     - `apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py` - Selenium interface placeholder
     - `apps/content_extractor/selectors/pattern_generalizer.py` - Pattern analysis placeholder
     - `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/start_extraction_project.py` - Management command placeholder

** Rationale
   - Complete app structure enables focused implementation by future models
   - Data models support entire workflow from project creation to selector validation
   - Placeholder files provide clear implementation guidance without premature coding
   - Admin configuration enables immediate testing of model relationships

* Turn 5: Implementation Planning and Documentation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Documentation phase]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User emphasized focus on skeleton setup rather than implementation
   - Created comprehensive 5-phase implementation plan with effort estimates
   - Updated active work tracking to focus entirely on new Content Extractor project
   - Established clear handoff documentation for seamless model transition

** Changes Made
   - **Updated `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org`**: Complete rewrite focusing on Content Extractor system with detailed implementation phases (20-30 model session estimates)
   - **Implementation Plan**: Detailed technical requirements, dependencies, file structure, and success criteria for each phase
   - **Resource Planning**: Identified key dependencies (selenium, beautifulsoup4, lxml, webdriver-manager) and integration points

** Rationale
   - Comprehensive planning enables efficient implementation without repeated architecture decisions
   - Clear phase breakdown allows incremental development with testing at each step
   - Effort estimates help with project planning and resource allocation
   - Success criteria provide objective measures for phase completion

* Turn 6: User Course Correction and Cleanup
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Final phase]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User reminded focus should be on basic setup rather than deep implementation
   - Acknowledged current work as appropriate skeleton/structure creation
   - Requested cleanup protocol execution to complete handoff process

** Final Status
   - **Content Extractor App**: Complete skeleton with models, admin, placeholder files
   - **Implementation Plan**: Comprehensive 5-phase roadmap ready for execution
   - **Active Work Tracking**: Updated with detailed project focus and priorities
   - **Documentation**: Ready for seamless handoff to implementation-focused models

** Next Steps Identified
   1. **IMMEDIATE**: Django app integration (settings, migrations)
   2. **PHASE 1**: HTML processing foundation implementation
   3. **PHASE 2**: Human-in-the-loop Selenium interface development

* Turn 7: Approach Clarification and Documentation Update
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Session continuation]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User requested clarification in documentation to emphasize human-in-the-loop approach
   - Noted that some references still sounded like automatic tree detection system
   - Asked to update active work tracking and other files to clearly reflect current methodology
   - Confirmed we are NOT doing automatic content detection - humans manually select elements

** Changes Made
   - **Updated `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org`**: Comprehensive revision throughout
     - Changed title from "Human-in-the-Loop HTML Analysis" to "Human-Guided Content Selection"  
     - Added explicit ":APPROACH: Human-in-the-Loop (No Automatic Detection)" property
     - Added "Core Methodology" section clearly stating no automatic detection
     - Updated all phase descriptions to emphasize human role vs system role
     - Added notes throughout clarifying "NO automatic analysis" and "NO content identification"
     - Updated success criteria to reflect human-driven workflow

** Rationale
   - Essential to be crystal clear about methodology to avoid confusion for future models
   - Previous language could be misinterpreted as having automatic components
   - Human-in-the-loop is fundamentally different approach requiring different implementation
   - Clear role separation (human selects, system learns) guides proper implementation

** Key Clarifications Made
   - **Human Role**: Manually select content elements through interactive interface
   - **System Role**: Provide selection tools, capture selections, generate selectors from human input
   - **No Automatic Detection**: System does not attempt to identify content regions algorithmically
   - **Pattern Learning**: System learns patterns from consistent human selections, not content analysis

** Cross-References
  - Updated documentation: `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org`
  - Session context: This conversation log entry

* Cross-References
  - Cleanup Report: `.project_management/cleanup_reports/stellar_beacon_cleanup.org`

  - Active Work Tracking: `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org`
  - Content Extractor Models: `apps/content_extractor/models.py`

* Session Outcome
  **SKELETON SETUP COMPLETE**: Created comprehensive foundation for Content Extractor system with clear implementation roadmap for future models. System designed for human-guided HTML content selection and robust selector generation across similar pages.

  **APPROACH CLARIFIED**: Documentation now explicitly emphasizes human-in-the-loop methodology with no automatic content detection components.

  **Status**: Ready for Phase 1 implementation with Django integration and HTML processing foundation.
