* Turn 1: AIPreparationRecord Admin Interface Implementation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User discovered that AIPreparationRecord models were not accessible through Wagtail's admin interface. They expected to see the AI preparation records in Wagtail's admin panel but found they were only registered in Django's standard admin interface. User specifically requested integration into Wagtail's interface for unified admin experience.

** Analysis Completed
- ✅ Confirmed AIPreparationRecord admin interface already exists in Wagtail
- ✅ Found 4 AIPreparationRecord entries in database from previous tests
- ✅ Verified Wagtail ModelAdmin integration in `wagtail_hooks.py`
- ✅ Confirmed AIPreparationRecordAdmin class is properly configured
- ✅ ContentExtractorAdminGroup registered with Wagtail

** Current Issue Identified
The AIPreparationRecord should be accessible in Wagtail admin at:
- **Menu Location**: Content Extractor → AI Preparation Records
- **Current Status**: ModelAdmin registered but user having access issues
- **Server**: Running on http://127.0.0.1:8002/admin/

** Changes Made
- Started Django server on port 8002 for testing
- Verified database contains test records (4 entries)
- Confirmed Wagtail integration is properly configured

** Rationale
The AIPreparationRecord needs to be accessible through Wagtail's admin interface for unified content management. The integration exists but user needs clear instructions on accessing it within Wagtail's admin panel structure.

** Next Steps Identified
1. Guide user to correct Wagtail admin menu location
2. Verify AI Preparation Records appear in Content Extractor menu
3. Test record creation and management through Wagtail interface
4. Document access instructions for future reference
