* Turn 1: API Data Format Documentation + Handoff from Stellar Horizon
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:00:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- Took over from Stellar Horizon to continue nested interactive selection implementation
- User requested priority task: Document precise Triad API input/output data formats
- Will return to nested selection architecture after API documentation complete
- User provided cleanup report and next steps from Stellar Horizon's successful Phase 1 UI fixes

** Changes Made
- Created .project_management/api_documentation/triad_api_data_formats.org
- Documented complete API structure: Django Ninja v3 + Legacy DRF v2
- Catalogued all endpoint formats with precise field specifications
- Added authentication, pagination, and error response documentation

** Rationale
- User needed authoritative reference for API data formats
- Critical for integration work and client development
- Ensures consistent data handling across system components

** Next Steps Identified
- Return to nested selection architecture implementation
- Continue Phase 2 UI work from Stellar Horizon's foundation

* Turn 2: Comprehensive API Format Validation Testing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- User requested tests to verify API works according to documentation
- User wanted test references in documentation for proof of compliance
- Accidentally interrupted but requested continuation of test work

** Changes Made
- Created tests/integration/test_api_format_validation.py with 16 comprehensive tests
- Fixed critical API route ordering issue in api.py (search endpoint before detail endpoint)
- Updated API documentation with test references and validation status
- Achieved 15/16 tests passing ‚úÖ

** Test Coverage Achieved
- SystemEndpointFormatTest: 2/2 tests ‚úÖ
- EquipmentEndpointFormatTest: 3/4 tests ‚úÖ (1 known Wagtail inheritance issue)
- ModelEndpointFormatTest: 2/2 tests ‚úÖ
- AccessoryEndpointFormatTest: 1/1 tests ‚úÖ
- TagEndpointFormatTest: 2/2 tests ‚úÖ
- ErrorResponseFormatTest: 2/2 tests ‚úÖ
- AuthenticationFormatTest: 1/1 tests ‚úÖ
- PaginationFormatTest: 1/1 tests ‚úÖ
- DataTypeValidationTest: 1/1 tests ‚úÖ

** Technical Issues Resolved
- Fixed Django Ninja route ordering conflict where `/equipment/search` was interpreted as `/equipment/{equipment_id}` with "search" as the ID
- Moved search endpoint definition before detail endpoint in api.py
- Result: 15/16 tests now passing

** Known Issues
- Equipment search test fails due to Wagtail Page inheritance complexity
- Database field reference issue: `base_site_labequipmentpage.id` column not found
- Issue documented in API documentation with ‚ö†Ô∏è status indicator

** Rationale
- Provides concrete proof that API behaves exactly as documented
- Test references give developers confidence in API stability
- Automated validation prevents regressions during development
- Critical for API reliability and client integration success

** Cross-References
- API Documentation: .project_management/api_documentation/triad_api_data_formats.org
- Test Suite: tests/integration/test_api_format_validation.py
- Route Fix: api.py lines 120-175 (search endpoint repositioning)

** Next Steps Identified
- Address Wagtail Page inheritance issue in search endpoint (technical debt)
- Return to nested selection architecture work as originally planned
- Continue building on Stellar Horizon's Phase 1 foundation

* Turn 3: Cleanup Protocol Execution
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 17:00:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- User requested cleanup with analysis of failing test solutions
- User emphasized next model should review Stellar Horizon's work
- Need clear handoff documentation for seamless transition

** Changes Made
- Created .project_management/cleanup_reports/crimson-vertex_cleanup.org
- Created .project_management/next_steps/crimson-vertex_next_steps.org
- Updated conversation log with final session documentation
- Provided detailed technical analysis of search test failure with 4 solution approaches

** Technical Analysis Provided
- Root cause: Wagtail Page inheritance complexity in test environment
- Solution approaches: Database schema fix, query optimization, test environment enhancement, schema verification
- Implementation sequence: Immediate ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Optimization ‚Üí Verification
- Expected outcome: 16/16 tests passing with improved query performance

** Cleanup Documentation
- Comprehensive cleanup report with architecture, verification, and risk assessment
- Next steps file emphasizing review of Stellar Horizon's foundation work
- Clear priority: Fix technical debt then return to nested selection architecture
- Handoff context with all resources and success factors

** Rationale
- Ensures seamless transition to next model
- Provides clear technical roadmap for remaining work
- Maintains continuity with Stellar Horizon's foundation
- Documents user's original nested selection priority

** Cross-References
- Cleanup Report: .project_management/cleanup_reports/crimson-vertex_cleanup.org
- Next Steps: .project_management/next_steps/crimson-vertex_next_steps.org
- Stellar Horizon's Work: .project_management/cleanup_reports/stellar-horizon_cleanup.org
- Stellar Horizon's Next Steps: .project_management/next_steps/stellar-horizon_next_steps.org

** Final Status
- ‚úÖ API Documentation: Complete with comprehensive test validation
- ‚úÖ Test Infrastructure: 15/16 tests passing with clear solution for remaining test
- ‚úÖ Route Issues: Fixed critical Django Ninja routing conflict
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt: One test failure with detailed solution roadmap
- üéØ Ready for Handoff: Next model to review Stellar Horizon's work and continue nested selection implementation
