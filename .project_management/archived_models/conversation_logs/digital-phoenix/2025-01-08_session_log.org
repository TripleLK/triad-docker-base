* Turn 1: JavaScript Injection Issues and Syntax Errors
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [TIMESTAMP]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User reported that the refactored interactive selector is not working - clicking the "Select Fields" button does nothing. Investigation revealed:
1. Linter errors in interactive_selector.py with malformed try statements
2. JavaScript error: "showFieldMenu is not defined" when clicking buttons
3. Our injected JavaScript is not available in the browser

** Changes Made
- Added debugging to show_field_menu() method to check JavaScript availability
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Attempted to fix timing issues with time.sleep(0.5)

** Issues Identified
1. Syntax errors in interactive_selector.py (lines 110, 205)
2. JavaScript injection timing/availability problem
3. Possible interference from website's own JavaScript
4. The control panel appears but buttons are non-functional

** Root Cause Analysis
The modular refactoring by Thunder Apex created working components, but the JavaScript injection mechanism has timing or persistence issues. The injected code may be:
- Not executing properly due to timing
- Being overwritten by the website's JavaScript
- Not being injected at the right moment in page lifecycle

** Next Steps Identified
1. Fix Python syntax errors first
2. Investigate JavaScript injection timing - may need to inject after page fully loads
3. Consider using MutationObserver to detect when our elements are removed
4. Add JavaScript error handling and re-injection capability
5. Test with simpler webpage to isolate injection issues
