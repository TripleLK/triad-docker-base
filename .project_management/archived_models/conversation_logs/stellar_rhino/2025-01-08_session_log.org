* Turn 1: User Requirements Analysis for Multi-Selector Enhancements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 10:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested significant UX improvements for the multi-selector field selection system:

1. **Multi-Instance Selection**: Need ability to select multiple elements for single logical instance, then mark completion and start next instance
2. **Non-Selecting Page Interaction**: Need modifier key (like Ctrl+click) to navigate pages without accidentally selecting elements  
3. **UI-Based Operations**: Replace command-line interface with floating UI controls for save/test/navigation operations
4. **Text Input Fields**: Allow direct text entry as alternative to element selection
5. **Field List Cleanup**: Remove AI-specific fields (data_completeness, specification_confidence, needs_review)

** Changes Made
- Created comprehensive cleanup report analyzing current state and gaps
- Documented architectural decisions needed for enhancements
- Created detailed next steps with specific implementation guidance
- Identified key files and line numbers for modifications
- Established priority matrix for implementation phases

** Rationale
Current system delivered by Crimson Phoenix provides solid foundation with site-specific storage and cross-page testing, but lacks intuitive UX for production use. These enhancements address real user workflow pain points:
- Accidental selection during page navigation
- Clunky multi-instance data entry  
- Command-line dependency breaks browser workflow
- AI-focused fields confuse manual users

** Analysis of Current Implementation
Reviewed three key files:
- `apps/content_extractor/models.py` (1-329): Database models support requirements
- `apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py` (1-1481): Core JavaScript needs major enhancement  
- `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/site_field_selector.py` (1-311): CLI interface to be replaced

** Next Steps Identified
Phase 1 priorities (immediate):
1. Remove AI fields from FIELD_OPTIONS array (~30 min)
2. Implement Ctrl+click non-selecting interaction (~2 hours)
3. Add floating UI control panel (~4 hours)
4. Create multi-instance selection logic (~6 hours)

** Cross-References
- Cleanup report: `.project_management/cleanup_reports/stellar_rhino_cleanup.org`
- Next steps: `.project_management/next_steps/stellar_rhino_next_steps.org`
- Previous work: Crimson Phoenix conversation logs and implementation
- Test URLs: AirScience validated URLs for multi-instance testing

** Architecture Impact
JavaScript event handling system needs refactoring for:
- Layered event modes (selection vs navigation vs preview)
- Instance grouping data structures
- UI control integration without page interference

Database schema changes minimal:
- Field choices cleanup in SiteFieldSelector model
- Future consideration for InstanceGroup model for complex multi-instance data

** Technical Risks Identified
- JavaScript complexity increase may affect stability
- Cross-browser modifier key compatibility  
- UI controls must not interfere with page content
- Need extensive testing for new interaction patterns

** User Experience Impact
Major improvements expected:
- Eliminates accidental selection frustration
- Streamlines multi-instance data entry workflow
- Removes context switching to command line
- Provides text input alternative for appropriate fields
- Cleans confusing AI-specific field options
