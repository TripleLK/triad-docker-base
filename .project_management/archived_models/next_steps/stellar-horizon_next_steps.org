* CRITICAL: Nested Selection Context Architecture üèóÔ∏è

** Core Concept (FROM USER INSIGHT)
When selecting "models", user should enter a models-specific input mode that contains:
- Sub-field selection menu (model_name, model_number, specifications, etc.)
- Each sub-field can open its own selection interface
- Recursive, modular design that reuses selection components
- Visual depth indicators (border colors) to show nesting level

** Technical Requirements
1. **Modular Selection Interface**
   - Extract current selection logic into reusable components
   - Design components that can be embedded at any depth level
   - Maintain consistent API across nesting levels

2. **Context Management**
   - Track current selection depth and parent context
   - Preserve parent selections while navigating sub-selections
   - Handle context switching and navigation

3. **Visual Feedback System**
   - Border color indicators for selection depth
   - Subtle visual cues for current context
   - Clear navigation breadcrumbs or indicators

** Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 2A: Component Modularization**
   - Refactor existing selection interface into modular components
   - Create base SelectionContext class that can be nested
   - Implement context switching and depth tracking

2. **Phase 2B: Recursive Interface**
   - Build nested selection context system
   - Implement sub-field menu within parent field contexts
   - Add visual depth indicators and navigation aids

3. **Phase 2C: Testing & Polish**
   - Comprehensive testing of nested selections
   - Performance optimization for deep nesting
   - User experience refinement

* Immediate Next Steps (For Next Model) üìã

** HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Analyze Current Code Structure**
   - Review interactive_selector.py selection logic
   - Identify components that can be modularized
   - Map out current field selection workflow

2. **Design Modular Architecture**
   - Create SelectionContext base class
   - Define interfaces for nested selection components
   - Plan depth tracking and visual feedback system

3. **Prototype Basic Nesting**
   - Implement simple two-level nesting (field -> sub-field)
   - Test context switching and preservation
   - Validate modular component approach

** MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. **Enhanced Auto-Fill for Nested Contexts**
   - Extend auto-fill to work within sub-field contexts
   - Smart detection of sub-field content patterns
   - Context-aware field population

2. **Advanced Visual Feedback**
   - Implement border color depth indicators
   - Add breadcrumb navigation for deep nesting
   - Context-aware UI element styling

** LOW PRIORITY
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize for deep nesting scenarios
   - Implement lazy loading for complex hierarchies
   - Memory management for multiple contexts

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Cross-context validation and testing
   - Bulk operations across nested selections
   - Import/export of complex selection hierarchies

* Technical Debt to Address üîß

** Current Sub-Menu Implementation
- Remove incorrect compound field name approach
- Clean up linear sub-menu selection code
- Preserve working custom modal system

** Code Organization
- Better separation of concerns in interactive_selector.py
- Extract UI components from core selection logic
- Improve error handling for nested contexts

* Success Metrics üìä

** User Experience Goals
- Intuitive navigation through nested selections
- Clear visual feedback for current context
- Seamless switching between selection depths
- Preserved context when navigating hierarchies

** Technical Goals
- Modular, reusable selection components
- Efficient context management
- Robust error handling for complex nesting
- Maintainable and extensible architecture

* Resources Available üõ†Ô∏è

** Working Foundation
- Stable custom modal system (no disappearing prompts)
- Comprehensive test harness (`test_interactive_selector.py`)
- Enhanced logging and debugging infrastructure
- Validated test URLs for airscience.com domain

** Documentation
- Stellar Horizon cleanup report with architectural insights
- Conversation logs with detailed implementation history
- User feedback and requirements clarification

** Testing Environment
- Chrome WebDriver setup with comprehensive logging
- Test URLs covering various page types
- Error tracking and debugging capabilities

* Key Reminders for Next Model üí°

1. **User Priority**: Functionality over aesthetics - keep UI simple but powerful
2. **Architecture First**: Design modular components before implementation
3. **Visual Feedback**: Border colors for depth indication are important UX element
4. **Code Reuse**: Same selection interface should work at all nesting levels
5. **Context Preservation**: Never lose parent selections when navigating sub-selections
