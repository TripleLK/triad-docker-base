* IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

** 1. Fix Python Syntax Errors (CRITICAL)
The interactive_selector.py has linter errors that prevent proper execution:
- Line 110: Malformed try statement indentation
- Line 205: Incorrect return statement indentation

** 2. Resolve JavaScript Injection Timing
The core issue is that our JavaScript functions are not available when buttons are clicked.

*** Root Problem
- Control panel appears correctly (HTML injection works)
- But clicking "Select Fields" button gives error: "showFieldMenu is not defined"
- This indicates JavaScript code is not persisting or not being injected at right time

*** Investigation Strategy
1. Test on simpler webpage (like google.com) to isolate if it's site-specific
2. Add console.log statements to verify JavaScript execution
3. Use setTimeout/setInterval to re-inject periodically if needed
4. Consider injecting JavaScript AFTER page's own JS finishes loading

** 3. Enhanced JavaScript Persistence
Consider these approaches:
- MutationObserver to detect if our elements get removed
- Periodic re-injection every few seconds
- Event listeners for page changes that trigger re-injection
- Injection at different page lifecycle events (DOMContentLoaded, load, etc.)

* TECHNICAL APPROACH

** Current Architecture Status
Thunder Apex successfully modularized the code into:
- js_injection.py (657 lines) - JavaScript generation
- database_operations.py (429 lines) - Database persistence  
- navigation_manager.py (392 lines) - Navigation logic
- interactive_selector.py (442 lines) - Main orchestrator

The modular design is solid, but the JavaScript injection mechanism needs work.

** Recommended Fix Strategy
1. Fix syntax errors first (blocking issue)
2. Add JavaScript console debugging to injection process
3. Test with multiple injection strategies:
   - Immediate injection after page load
   - Delayed injection (setTimeout)
   - Periodic re-injection
   - Event-based re-injection

** Testing Protocol
1. Start with simple test page to verify injection works
2. Test on target airscience.com page
3. Verify both control panel appearance AND button functionality
4. Test nested navigation once basic injection works

* CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

** What Works
- Page loading and basic setup
- Modular component architecture
- Control panel HTML appears correctly
- Nested selection context system design

** What's Broken
- JavaScript function definitions not persisting
- Button click handlers not working
- Field menu not displaying when requested

** Quick Win Opportunities
- Fix syntax errors (should be < 5 minutes)
- Add better error logging to identify injection failure point
- Test injection timing with setTimeout delays

* FILES TO FOCUS ON
1. apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py (fix syntax)
2. apps/content_extractor/selectors/js_injection.py (injection timing)
3. Test with: python manage.py test_nested_selector --interactive
