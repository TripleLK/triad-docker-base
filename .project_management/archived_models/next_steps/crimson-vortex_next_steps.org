* CRITICAL HANDOFF ISSUE

** ðŸš¨ Field Menu Display Problem - IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
*** Problem Statement
Field menu (#field-selection-menu) not appearing during testing despite complete draggable implementation.
Chrome driver errors indicate webdriver session management issues.

*** Error Symptoms
```
web view not found
target window already closed  
Message: no such window: target window already closed
```

*** Required Investigation Steps
1. **Test Basic Functionality First**
   - Comment out all makeDraggable() calls temporarily
   - Run: `python manage.py test_nested_selector`
   - Verify basic field menu appears without draggable features

2. **Webdriver Session Debugging**
   - Check browser window lifecycle in test_nested_selector.py
   - Verify webdriver instance remains valid throughout test
   - Investigate premature browser closure

3. **Chrome Driver Compatibility**
   - Check Chrome browser version vs chromedriver version
   - Update chromedriver if version mismatch found
   - Test with different Chrome driver options

4. **JavaScript Injection Verification**
   - Add console logging to verify script injection completes
   - Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
   - Validate _inject_selection_js() execution success

5. **CSS Interference Investigation** 
   - Previous models noted CSS overriding issues
   - Verify `!important` declarations are effective
   - Test with additional CSS specificity

* UI Enhancement Priorities (After Critical Issue Resolved)

** PRIORITY 1: Complete Draggable Menu System âœ… (IMPLEMENTED BUT UNTESTED)
*** Status: Code Complete - Awaiting Validation
- Draggable functionality fully implemented in JavaScript injection
- makeDraggable() function with comprehensive feature set
- Applied to field selection menu and control panel
- **BLOCKED**: Cannot test due to menu display issue

*** Implementation Details (Already Complete)
- Global drag state management in window.contentExtractorData.dragging
- Visual drag indicators (dots pattern in top-right corner)
- Mouse event handlers for full drag lifecycle
- Viewport boundary constraints
- Visual feedback (opacity, scaling, shadows)
- Proper event handling to prevent button interference

** PRIORITY 2: Un-select Functionality Implementation 
*** Requirements (From Original Next Steps)
- Allow deselection of elements at ALL nested levels
- Clear visual indication when elements are unselected
- Maintain selection state consistency across nested contexts
- Enable bulk unselect functionality

*** Implementation Approach
- Add un-select event handlers to selected elements
- Implement visual state changes for unselected items
- Update field selection arrays to remove unselected items
- Add "Clear All" or "Unselect All" buttons to control panel

** PRIORITY 3: Field Swapping System Implementation
*** Requirements (From Original Next Steps)  
- Three distinct field modes:
  1. **Miscellaneous Notes**: User can add custom text notes
  2. **Site Metadata**: Extract metadata (title, description, etc.)
  3. **Human Text Input**: Manual content entry for difficult fields

*** Implementation Approach
- Add mode toggle buttons to control panel
- Create input interfaces for each mode type
- Integrate with existing field selection workflow
- Provide clear visual indication of current mode

* Technical Resources

** Key Files
- **apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py**: Core implementation (draggable code ~lines 2257-2400)
- **apps/content_extractor/management/commands/test_nested_selector.py**: Test harness
- **apps/content_extractor/selectors/selection_context.py**: Nested context management

** Working Test URLs
- https://www.airscience.com/product-category-page?brandname=safefume-fuming-chambers&brand=14
- https://www.airscience.com/product-category-page?brandname=purair-flow-laminar-flow-cabinets&brand=13

** Testing Commands
```bash
# Basic test (should show field menu)
python manage.py test_nested_selector

# Interactive mode (command-based)  
python manage.py test_nested_selector --interactive

# Automated demo
python manage.py test_nested_selector --demo
```

* Architecture Context

** Validated Foundation (From Stellar Phoenix)
- Nested object selection architecture: âœ… PRODUCTION-READY
- User testing confirmed: "nested menus worked very well!"
- Comprehensive test suite: âœ… FUNCTIONAL
- Database integration: âœ… WORKING

** Implementation Status
- Priority 1 (Draggable): ðŸŸ¡ COMPLETE CODE, BLOCKED BY DISPLAY ISSUE
- Priority 2 (Un-select): ðŸ”´ NOT STARTED
- Priority 3 (Field Swapping): ðŸ”´ NOT STARTED

* Success Criteria

** For Critical Issue Resolution
- Field menu appears consistently in browser window
- No Chrome driver session errors
- JavaScript injection completes successfully
- Basic field selection workflow operational

** For Priority Completion
- All UI elements draggable with smooth visual feedback
- Complete un-select functionality across all nested levels
- Three-mode field swapping system fully operational
- User testing validation of all enhancements

* Next Model Action Plan

1. **STEP 1**: Resolve critical field menu display issue (IMMEDIATE)
2. **STEP 2**: Validate draggable functionality with user testing  
3. **STEP 3**: Implement Priority 2 (un-select functionality)
4. **STEP 4**: Implement Priority 3 (field swapping system)
5. **STEP 5**: Comprehensive user testing of all three priorities
