*** Test the Working System
- Run `python manage.py test_nested_selector` with various options
- Test interactive mode: `python manage.py test_nested_selector --interactive`
- Explore demo mode: `python manage.py test_nested_selector --demo`
- Try different URLs and headless options

*** Analyze Working Commands
Review the preserved management commands to understand full capabilities:
- `test_nested_selector.py` (318 lines) - Main nested field selection system
- `site_field_selector.py` (311 lines) - Site-specific field selection
- `field_selector.py` (274 lines) - Core field selection logic
- `test_selector.py` (172 lines) - Testing functionality

** Document Working Workflow
*** End-to-End Process Understanding
1. How does the current field selection interface work?
2. What data does it extract and how?
3. How does it integrate with AIPreparationRecord model?
4. What are the current JSON configuration capabilities?

*** Upload Integration Analysis
- Review `upload_config.html` template (129 lines)
- Understand how JSON configurations upload and process
- Test upload workflow with working field selection data
- Verify AIPreparationRecord creation and admin interface

* Phase 2: User Experience Testing (Week 1)

** Admin Interface Testing

- Additional field selection commands for different use cases
- Integration with other Django apps if needed

* Strategic Focus and Principles

** Core Development Philosophy
- **Enhance, Don't Replace**: Build on proven working functionality
- **User-Centric**: Focus on actual user needs and pain points
- **Incremental**: Small, valuable improvements over major changes
- **Quality**: Polish existing features rather than adding complexity

** Avoid These Approaches
- Don't recreate selenium complexity unless clearly justified
- Don't replace working systems without strong user demand
- Don't add features without clear user benefit
- Don't sacrifice working functionality for new capabilities

* Risk Mitigation

** Potential Challenges
1. **Understanding Complex System** - The nested field selection is sophisticated
2. **Maintaining Working Functionality** - Don't break what works
3. **User Experience Consistency** - Maintain professional admin styling

** Mitigation Strategies
1. **Thorough Testing Before Changes** - Understand system completely first
2. **Small, Incremental Changes** - Test each improvement individually
3. **User Feedback Integration** - Focus on actual user needs vs assumed needs

* Handoff Requirements for Next Model

** Immediate Priorities
1. **Test Working System** - Run `test_nested_selector` with all options thoroughly
2. **Document Current Capabilities** - Understand what the working system does
3. **Identify Quick Wins** - Find 2-3 small improvements for immediate value
4. **Plan Enhancement Strategy** - Focus on incremental improvements to working system

** Key Files to Review First
- `test_nested_selector.py` - The main working system
- `upload_config.html` - The working upload interface  
- `wagtail_hooks.py` - The cleaned admin integration
- AIPreparationRecord model - Data model integration
