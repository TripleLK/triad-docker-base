* URGENT: Fix XPath Editor Integration Issues

** CONTEXT
Silver Phoenix implemented complete AI Preparation System foundation:
- ✅ AIPreparationRecord model (complete)
- ✅ Django admin interface (complete) 
- ✅ XPath editor modal JavaScript (complete - 910 lines)
- ❌ Integration with existing selection menu (BROKEN)

** CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

*** Issue 1: XPath Editor Not Triggered by Menu Arrows
- **Problem**: Clicking ">" arrows in Selections menu doesn't open XPath editor
- **Expected**: ">" arrow click should open XPath editor modal
- **Current**: No response or wrong action occurs

*** Issue 2: XPath Field Not Populated
- **Problem**: When XPath editor opens, the XPath input field is empty
- **Expected**: Should be pre-populated with selected element's XPath
- **Current**: Empty field requiring manual XPath entry

** SPECIFIC TASKS FOR NEXT MODEL

*** Task 1: Locate Menu Arrow Click Handlers
- **File to Check**: `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_ui.js`
- **Action**: Find where ">" arrows are created in selection menus
- **Goal**: Identify current click handler for ">" arrows

*** Task 2: Replace/Enhance Arrow Click Handler
- **Current Handler**: Replace with XPath editor trigger
- **Function to Call**: `ContentExtractorXPathEditor.openEditor(element, fieldName, xpath)`
- **Data Required**: Pass selected element, field name, and generated XPath

*** Task 3: Fix Data Flow
- **From**: Element selection and storage
- **To**: XPath editor modal
- **Requirements**: 
  - Get selected element from stored selection data
  - Generate correct XPath for element
  - Pass data to `openEditor()` function

*** Task 4: Test Integration
- **Workflow**: Select element → click ">" arrow → XPath editor opens with populated field
- **Verification**: 
  - Modal opens correctly
  - XPath field has correct value
  - Can edit and save to AI preparation record

** TECHNICAL DETAILS

*** XPath Editor API (Already Implemented)
```javascript
ContentExtractorXPathEditor.openEditor(element, fieldName, initialXPath)
```

*** Integration Points to Fix
1. **Menu Creation**: Where ">" arrows are added to selection items
2. **Click Handler**: What happens when ">" is clicked
3. **Data Retrieval**: Getting element and XPath for the modal

*** Files to Modify
- `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_ui.js` - Menu UI
- `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_events.js` - Event handlers
- Possibly others depending on selection storage system

** SUCCESS CRITERIA
✅ Click ">" arrow in selection menu → XPath editor modal opens
✅ XPath field is pre-populated with element's XPath
✅ Can edit XPath and see live preview
✅ Save creates AIPreparationRecord in database
✅ Admin interface shows saved records

** PRIORITY: CRITICAL
This is blocking live testing of the complete AI preparation system.
All backend components are ready - only integration layer needs fixing.

** ESTIMATED EFFORT: 1-2 model sessions
The components exist, they just need to be connected properly.
