* Current Project Status

** ONGOING: AI JSON to Lab Equipment Import System
- **Model**: Stellar Bridge (taking over from Dynamic Flux)
- **Status**: CRITICAL ISSUE - Core functionality 70% complete
- **Priority**: HIGH - Next model must resolve immediately

*** Completed (✅)
- Management command framework (`import_ai_json_to_equipment.py`)
- File discovery and JSON combination logic
- Basic LabEquipmentPage creation via API serializer
- SEO content import working
- Categorized tag association working

*** CRITICAL BLOCKER (❌)
- **Issue**: Nested object creation failing silently
- **Impact**: EquipmentModel, SpecGroup, Feature objects not created (count = 0)
- **Expected**: 9 models, 3+ spec groups, 7+ features
- **Status**: Ready for next model to debug immediately

*** Next Model Priorities
1. **URGENT**: Debug why `create_models()` method not executing
2. **URGENT**: Fix silent logging issues for debugging
3. Test with minimal data to isolate the problem
4. Add image import once models creation works

** Related Objectives
*** COMPLETED: AI JSON Export Enhancement (Dynamic Flux)
- Specification group names with title case formatting
- Combined AI JSON processing command
- Field selector error fixes
- Export shows all matches in details and subset files

*** TODO: Image Import Integration
- **Dependency**: Must wait for models creation fix
- **Status**: Blocked by current critical issue

* File Locations
** Current Work Files
- `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/import_ai_json_to_equipment.py`
- `apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py` (lines 250-420 enhanced)
- Test data: `analysis_outputs/page_jsons/SafeFUME/Claude 3.7 Sonnet/`

** Documentation
- Cleanup: `.project_management/cleanup_reports/stellar-bridge_cleanup.org`
- Next Steps: `.project_management/next_steps/stellar-bridge_next_steps.org`
- Conversation: `.project_management/conversation_logs/stellar-bridge/2025-01-22_session_log.org`

* Testing Status
** Working Commands
```bash
python manage.py import_ai_json_to_equipment analysis_outputs/page_jsons/SafeFUME/Claude\ 3.7\ Sonnet/ --verbose
```

** Verification Commands
```bash
# Check database state (currently shows models=0, should be 9)
python -c "from apps.base_site.models import *; page = LabEquipmentPage.objects.filter(title__icontains='SafeFUME').first(); print('Models:', page.models.count())"
```

** Cleanup for Testing
```bash
python -c "from apps.base_site.models import LabEquipmentPage; LabEquipmentPage.objects.filter(title__icontains='SafeFUME').delete()"
```

* Context for Next Session
The AI JSON import system is architected correctly and partially working. The issue is specifically in the Django REST Framework serializer's nested object creation methods. The next model should focus immediately on debugging this critical blocker before moving to additional features.

All infrastructure is in place - this is a focused debugging task that should resolve quickly once the root cause is identified.
