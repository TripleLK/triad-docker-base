** CRITICAL: Interactive Selector Architectural Refactoring - QUANTUM RIDGE HANDOFF
   SCHEDULED: <2025-01-08>
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ASSIGNED_TO: Velocity Compass
   :PRIORITY: CRITICAL
   :PROJECT_TYPE: Code Architecture & Maintainability
   :STATUS: Ready for Implementation
   :HANDOFF_FROM: Quantum Ridge
   :ISSUE: Monolithic file (4000+ lines) blocking development
   :END:

   **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DISCOVERY**: The interactive_selector.py file has grown to 4000+ lines and has become a development bottleneck, containing JavaScript injection, selection logic, navigation, UI management, and database operations all mixed together.

   **QUANTUM RIDGE ACCOMPLISHED**:
   ‚úÖ Fixed JavaScript brace escaping issues in f-strings
   ‚úÖ Started implementing 3-level hierarchy (showInstanceManagementMenu, createNewInstance functions)
   ‚úÖ Added instanceData support to window.contentExtractorData
   ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED: 3-level hierarchy components are incomplete and should be disabled first

   **IMMEDIATE TASKS**:

   *** PHASE 1: Disable Partial Implementation (1-2 hours)
   - [ ] Comment out new functions (lines 712-820, 905-920, 3101-3111)
   - [ ] Remove instanceData from window object
   - [ ] Verify existing functionality still works
   - [ ] Backup file: ‚úÖ apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector_backup_quantum_ridge.py

   *** PHASE 2: Split Monolithic File (4-6 hours)
   - [ ] **javascript/templates.py** - JavaScript injection
   - [ ] **navigation/nested_navigator.py** - Navigation logic  
   - [ ] **ui/menu_builder.py** - Menu and control panels
   - [ ] **core/selection_engine.py** - Core selection logic
   - [ ] **persistence/field_session_manager.py** - Database operations

   *** PHASE 3: Re-implement 3-level Hierarchy Cleanly (3-4 hours)
   - [ ] Clean implementation after modular architecture
   - [ ] Proper separation of concerns
   - [ ] Maintainable code structure

   **FOUNDATION STATUS**: Solid, but code structure needs improvement before feature development can continue efficiently.

** LabEquipmentPage Field Selector System - MAJOR DIRECTION CHANGE
   SCHEDULED: <2025-01-08>

** [üéØ] UI Enhancement & Field Flexibility - NEXT PRIORITIES
   OPENED: [2025-01-08]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ASSIGNED_TO: Next Model (TBD)
   :PRIORITY: High
   :DEPENDENCIES: Nested Selection Architecture (Complete)
   :USER_REQUIREMENTS: Clearly defined
   :END:
   
   **PRIORITY 1: Draggable Menu System**
   - Allow users to drag field menus around the screen
   - Menus should start in current default positions
   - No need to maintain positions between menu appearances
   - User can reposition for better workflow
   
   **PRIORITY 2: Un-select Functionality**
   - Allow users to deselect previously selected elements
   - Should work at all nested levels
   - Maintain selection state consistency
   
   **PRIORITY 3: Field Swapping System** 
   Implement ability to swap any field (at any nested level) for:
   - a) **Generic "select whatever"**: 
     * Goes to miscellaneous notes (not saved as field directly)
     * AI can use this info to help fill the actual field
     * Provides flexibility for edge cases
   - b) **Site metadata selection**:
     * URL, page title, other non-HTML data
     * Useful for context that's not in visible content
   - c) **Human text input**:
     * Allow direct text entry for any field
     * Manual override option

** [üìã] Miscellaneous Field Implementation - DEFERRED
   DEFERRED: [2025-01-08]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :REASON: User prioritized UI enhancements and field flexibility first
   :DEPENDENCIES: Field swapping system may partially address this need

   **OBJECTIVE**: Add "miscellaneous" field for useful information that won't display on models page
   
   **REQUIREMENTS**:
   - **Field Definition**: Add "miscellaneous" as selectable field option
   - **Non-Display**: Field won't be displayed on models page but contains useful information
   - **Storage**: Determine appropriate storage mechanism for supplementary data
   - **Field Type**: Likely multi-value field based on "useful information" requirement
   
   **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** (After User Testing):
   1. **Update Selection Context**: Add miscellaneous field to field definitions
   2. **Update Interactive Selector**: Add field to selection options
   3. **Storage Considerations**: Implement appropriate storage with non-display flag
   4. **Testing**: Verify miscellaneous field functionality
   
   **ARCHITECTURE READY**: Existing nested selection system designed to easily accommodate new field types
