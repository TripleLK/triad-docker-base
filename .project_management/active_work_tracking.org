* Current Master Goal
  :PROPERTIES:
  :STATUS: In Progress
  :PRIORITY: High
  :STARTED: [2025-01-19]
  :END:

** Primary Objective
   Restructure Wagtail website for medical equipment reseller
   - Focus: Improve app structure and remove unnecessary files
   - Goal: Cleaner codebase with logical organization

** Reorganization Strategy (Updated)
   Complete file organization in two phases:
   1. **Phase A (Current)**: Move ALL remaining files from root into triad-reorganized/ structure
   2. **Phase B (Future)**: Bulk move everything from triad-reorganized/ back to root as final structure
   
   This approach keeps current Django structure functional while organizing systematically.

** Success Criteria
   - [X] ALL files moved into triad-reorganized/ structure (Phase A) - COMPLETED by Thunder Hawk
   - [ ] Logical Django app organization established  
   - [ ] Unnecessary files identified and removed/archived
   - [X] AI collaboration framework fully operational
   - [ ] Documentation standards implemented
   - [X] File inventory system created
   - [ ] Future: Bulk consolidation from triad-reorganized/ to root (Phase B)
