** [‚è≥] Miscellaneous Field Implementation - WAITING FOR USER VALIDATION
   SCHEDULED: <After User Testing>  
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ASSIGNED_TO: Stellar Phoenix
   :PRIORITY: HIGH (after testing)
   :PROJECT_TYPE: Field Enhancement
   :STATUS: Ready for Implementation After User Testing
   :BLOCKED_BY: User Testing Validation
   :END:
   
   **OBJECTIVE**: Add "miscellaneous" field for useful information that won't display on models page
   
   **REQUIREMENTS**:
   - **Field Definition**: Add "miscellaneous" as selectable field option
   - **Non-Display**: Field won't be displayed on models page but contains useful information
   - **Storage**: Determine appropriate storage mechanism for supplementary data
   - **Field Type**: Likely multi-value field based on "useful information" requirement
   
   **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** (After User Testing):
   1. **Update Selection Context**: Add miscellaneous field to field definitions
   2. **Update Interactive Selector**: Add field to selection options
   3. **Storage Considerations**: Implement appropriate storage with non-display flag
   4. **Testing**: Verify miscellaneous field functionality
   
   **ARCHITECTURE READY**: Existing nested selection system designed to easily accommodate new field types 

* CURRENT STATUS: üéØ UI POLISH & CONSISTENCY PHASE

** COMPLETED WORK: ‚úÖ Backend Infrastructure (Thunder Vortex)
- ‚úÖ CRITICAL: Fixed Django API 500 errors completely
- ‚úÖ Backend API endpoints fully functional (GET/POST)
- ‚úÖ Frontend/backend data format compatibility resolved
- ‚úÖ Automatic selector loading 100% operational
- ‚úÖ Save functionality working end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Authentication system repaired and functional

** ACTIVE PRIORITIES: ÔøΩÔøΩ Next Model Focus

*** üéØ PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Generalized XPath Selector Multi-Element Highlighting
**** Mission: Fix XPath selectors to highlight ALL matching elements instead of just the first one
**** Current Issue: `features` field shows "1 selected" but generalized XPath should highlight all matching tabs
**** Technical Focus: Enhance `applyExistingSelectors()` to find and highlight all XPath matches
**** Priority: Feature Enhancement (functionality working, needs visual completeness)
**** Assigned To: Next Model
**** Estimated Effort: 2-3 hours (XPath evaluation and highlighting logic enhancement)

*** üéØ PRIORITY 2: Unified Field/Subfield System (ARCHITECTURE)
**** Problem  
- Subfields implemented separately from main fields
- Massive code duplication (~40% of selection logic)
- Subfields lack XPath editing capabilities of main fields
- Inconsistent user experience between field types

**** Technical Root Cause
- Separate handlers: handleElementClick vs handleSubfieldElementClick
- Different XPath editor integration paths
- Isolated save logic for subfields
- Duplicated menu creation patterns

**** Implementation Required
- Abstract common functionality into shared components
- Create unified selection context system
- Migrate both field types to shared architecture
- Eliminate duplicate code paths

**** Architecture Goal
```javascript
// Unified approach needed:
const selectionContext = {
    type: 'field' | 'subfield',
    fieldName: 'title',
    instanceIndex: 0,      // subfields only
    subfieldName: 'brand'  // subfields only
};
```

** SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: üîß Polish & Optimization
- Menu performance optimization
- Better visual feedback consistency
- Code organization improvements
- Error handling standardization

* RECENT PROGRESS SUMMARY

** Thunder Vortex Session (2025-01-22): ‚úÖ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
