    - Set up cleanup protocol with reporting and next steps
    - Created directory structure for AI collaboration
    - Documented framework in detail for future models

*** Next Handoff Priorities
    See `.project_management/next_steps/silver-mongoose_next_steps.org` for complete details.
    1. Test AI collaboration framework
    2. Update project architecture document
    3. Begin file inventory assessment
    4. Analyze Django app structure

** Session 2: File Reorganization Implementation [2025-01-19]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :MODEL: Rapid Falcon
   :STATUS: Completed
   :END:

*** Completed Tasks
    - [X] Conducted comprehensive file inventory assessment
    - [X] Created reorganized Django project structure (triad-reorganized/)
    - [X] Migrated core Django functionality to new structure
    - [X] Verified Django system functionality (checks, server startup)
    - [X] Enhanced AI collaboration framework with premature cutoff recovery
    - [X] Updated conversation logging and model tracking systems

*** Accomplishments
    - Successfully created organized Django structure with all apps functional
    - Confirmed development server works and all Django checks pass
    - Identified and partially resolved Django settings configuration issues
    - Created foundation for systematic file consolidation
    - Documented complete file inventory and reorganization plan

*** Issues Identified
    - Django settings configuration issue preventing admin panel access
    - `create_admin.py` script fails despite correcting settings module path
    - Still requires environment variable and configuration investigation

*** Next Handoff Priorities
    See `.project_management/next_steps/rapid-falcon_next_steps.org` for complete details.
    1. Resolve Django settings configuration issue
    2. Complete file organization structure
    3. Test reorganized structure functionality
    4. Begin systematic file consolidation

* Project Structure Priorities

** Phase 1: Framework Setup (Current)
   - [X] AI collaboration rules established
   - [X] File tracking systems operational
   - [X] Documentation standards defined
   - [X] File inventory assessment completed
   - [X] Reorganized Django structure created and tested

** Phase 2: File Organization (In Progress)
   - [X] Basic Django structure reorganized
   - [ ] Complete organized directory structure
   - [ ] Consolidate scattered scripts and test files
   - [ ] Archive analysis output directories
   - [ ] Reorganize remaining files

** Phase 3: Django App Restructuring
   - [ ] Analyze current app structure
   - [ ] Design improved organization
   - [ ] Implement restructuring
   - [ ] Update documentation

** Phase 4: Code Quality & Testing
   - [ ] Implement coding standards
   - [ ] Add missing tests
   - [ ] Refactor problematic code
   - [ ] Performance optimization

* Notes and Considerations

** Key Insights
   - Project has significant scope creep - need focused cleanup
   - Multiple comparison output directories suggest analysis workflow
   - HTML analysis tools are core functionality
   - Equipment/API integration is important feature

** Potential Challenges
   - Large number of temporary/analysis files to organize
   - Complex Django app relationships to untangle
   - Maintaining functionality during restructuring

** Decision Points for User Discussion
   - Final structure for temporary file archiving
   - Specific Django app organization preferences
   - Priority order for cleanup activities
   - Testing requirements during restructuring
