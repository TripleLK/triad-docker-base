* Summary

Successfully implemented complete nested object selection architecture for the interactive content selector. Transformed the linear field selection system into a hierarchical context system where selecting nested fields like "models" opens recursive sub-contexts with appropriate field options. The implementation provides modular, reusable selection components that work at any depth level with proper visual hierarchy indicators.

** Major Accomplishments
- ✅ Complete nested selection architecture with recursive contexts
- ✅ Modular SelectionField/SelectionContext system supporting unlimited depth
- ✅ Enhanced InteractiveSelector with 6 new navigation methods
- ✅ Depth-based visual hierarchy (colors, borders, patterns, badges)
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation with clickable parent navigation
- ✅ Event-driven JavaScript↔Python communication system
- ✅ Comprehensive testing with automated demo validation

** User Requirements Fulfilled
All 5 core requirements from Stellar Horizon documentation successfully implemented:
1. Nested selection contexts (models → model-specific mode)
2. Recursive interface reusing same components at any depth
3. Modular components embeddable recursively
4. Visual depth indicators with border colors and patterns
5. Context preservation with breadcrumb navigation

  - Quantum Horizon entry marked as completed with full summary

* Reasoning

** Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Design**: Created separate selection_context.py for reusability and clear separation of concerns
- **Recursive Interface**: Used same SelectionContext class at all depth levels to ensure consistent behavior
- **Event-Driven Communication**: JavaScript events trigger Python callbacks for seamless UI↔backend integration
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Implemented depth-based colors and patterns to clearly indicate nesting level
- **Dynamic Field Options**: JavaScript receives current context fields rather than static options for flexibility

** Technical Choices
- **Dataclass Usage**: SelectionField and SelectionResult use dataclasses for clean data structures
- **Context Path Tracking**: Dot-separated paths (e.g., "models.0.spec_groups.1") for precise context identification
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Clickable navigation path for easy context switching
- **Depth Color Mapping**: Blue→Red→Orange→Green→Purple progression for visual clarity

** Alternative Approaches Considered
- Static nested menus vs. dynamic context switching (chose dynamic for flexibility)
- Server-side context management vs. client-side (chose hybrid for responsiveness)
- Fixed depth limits vs. unlimited nesting (chose unlimited for extensibility)

* Architecture

** New System Components
```
NestedSelectionManager
├── SelectionContext (recursive)
│   ├── SelectionField definitions
│   ├── Breadcrumb navigation
│   └── Sub-context management
├── Visual hierarchy system
│   ├── Depth-based colors
│   ├── Border patterns
│   └── Badge indicators
└── Event communication
    ├── JavaScript events
    └── Python polling
```

** Integration Points
- Enhanced InteractiveSelector constructor initializes NestedSelectionManager
- JavaScript injection dynamically generates field options from current context
- Event listeners handle nested navigation requests from UI
- Context state synchronization re-injects JavaScript after navigation

** Hierarchical Data Structure Support
```
LabEquipmentPage (root - depth 0)
├── models (nested - depth 1)
│   ├── name (single)
│   ├── model_number (single)  
│   └── spec_groups (nested - depth 2)
│       ├── name (single)
│       └── specs (multi-value)
├── spec_groups (nested direct - depth 1)
│   ├── name (single)
│   └── specs (multi-value)
└── features, accessories, etc. (multi-value)
```

* Issues

** None - Implementation Complete
- All user requirements successfully fulfilled
- Comprehensive testing validates functionality
- No blocking issues or incomplete features identified
- Architecture ready for production use

** Future Enhancement Opportunities
- Support for additional nested field types beyond models/spec_groups
- Performance optimization for deep nesting scenarios (>5 levels)
- Enhanced visual indicators for very deep hierarchies
- Batch selection operations across multiple context levels

* Verification

** Automated Testing Results
- ✅ **Demo test passed**: 3-level nested navigation (Root → models[0] → spec_groups[0])
- ✅ **Context switching validated**: Successful enter/exit at all levels
- ✅ **Visual hierarchy confirmed**: Proper depth indicators and breadcrumb navigation
- ✅ **Navigation verified**: Parent navigation and depth targeting working
- ✅ **Hierarchy export functional**: Complete selection tree export with context paths
- ✅ **Field validation working**: Context-aware field checking prevents invalid selections

** Manual Verification Performed
- Confirmed JavaScript injection works correctly with enhanced depth styling
- Validated breadcrumb navigation displays proper hierarchical path
- Tested event communication between JavaScript and Python
- Verified dynamic field options update based on current context
- Confirmed visual depth indicators (colors, borders, patterns) work as designed

** Integration Testing
- NestedSelectionManager properly integrates with existing InteractiveSelector
- Legacy FIELD_OPTIONS maintained for backward compatibility
- Enhanced JavaScript doesn't interfere with existing selection functionality
- Database models and Django integration remain unaffected
