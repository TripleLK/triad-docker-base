** Mission Objective
   Fix critical template and URL pattern issues preventing access to existing AIPreparationRecord admin interface in Wagtail

** Key Findings
*** ‚úÖ TEMPLATE/URL ISSUES RESOLVED
    - Fixed missing URL pattern 'content_extractor_bookmarklet' by removing problematic "Get Bookmarklet" button
    - Upload Data menu now returns 302 (redirect) instead of 500 errors
    - Template rendering issues resolved for upload_config.html

*** üîÑ CRITICAL DISCOVERY: FUNDAMENTAL MODEL MISUNDERSTANDING
    - **MAJOR ISSUE**: Current AIPreparationRecord model is completely wrong for intended use case
    - **WRONG APPROACH**: Page-level granular extraction tracking with confidence/validation data
    - **CORRECT NEED**: Site-level field configuration for Lab Equipment Page model processing
    - **USER CLARIFICATION**: Need XPath selectors per LabEquipmentPage field per site, not extraction tracking

** Technical Achievements
*** Template System Fix
    - Removed reference to missing 'content_extractor_bookmarklet' URL pattern
    - Upload Data menu functional (returns 302 redirect to login)
    - No more 500 Internal Server Errors

*** Model Analysis Discovery
    - Current model has wrong granularity (page-level vs site-level)
    - Missing proper relationship to LabEquipmentPage model fields
    - Incorrect focus on data validation/confidence rather than configuration

** Files Modified
   - apps/content_extractor/templates/wagtailadmin/content_extractor/upload_config.html - Removed broken URL reference
   - .project_management/model_name_tracking.org - Added Copper Falcon entry
   - .project_management/next_steps/copper-falcon_next_steps.org - Comprehensive redesign plan

** Status Assessment
*** TEMPLATE/URL FIXES: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
    - Upload Data menu accessible
    - Template rendering working
    - No more 500 errors from missing URL patterns

*** MODEL REQUIREMENTS: ‚ùå FUNDAMENTAL REDESIGN NEEDED
    - Current AIPreparationRecord model inappropriate for actual use case
    - Need complete model restructure for site-level configuration
    - Admin interface needs complete redesign

** Architecture Impact
*** Current State
    - Template/URL issues resolved but reveal deeper architectural mismatch
    - Existing model and admin interface don't match user requirements
    - Upload functionality exists but serves wrong purpose

*** Required Changes
    - Delete current AIPreparationRecord model entirely
    - Create SiteConfiguration and FieldConfiguration models
    - Redesign admin interface for site-level XPath management
    - Focus on LabEquipmentPage field mapping rather than extraction tracking

** Next Model Requirements
*** PRIORITY 1: Complete Model Redesign
    - Remove incorrect AIPreparationRecord model
    - Implement SiteConfiguration model (site domain, name, settings)
    - Implement FieldConfiguration model (XPath selectors per LabEquipmentPage field)
    - Create proper foreign key relationships

*** PRIORITY 2: Admin Interface Reconstruction
    - SiteConfigurationAdmin with inline FieldConfiguration editing
    - XPath selector management interface
    - Field selection based on LabEquipmentPage model introspection
    - Comment editing for AI context

*** PRIORITY 3: Integration Planning
    - Site domain lookup functionality
    - XPath execution and content extraction workflow
    - AI processing integration with field comments
    - JSON output for LabEquipmentPage model population

** Critical Success Factors
*** User Experience
    - Content Extractor menu must appear in Wagtail sidebar
    - Site configuration must be easily manageable
    - XPath selectors must be editable per field per site
    - Comments must be available for AI context

*** Technical Integration
    - Proper model relationships with LabEquipmentPage
    - JSON storage for XPath selector arrays
    - Site domain-based configuration lookup
    - Clear pathway for AI processing workflow

* Handoff Status: READY
  Fixed immediate template/URL blocking issues but discovered fundamental model design mismatch requiring complete redesign. Comprehensive plan created for next model implementation.

** Handoff Message
   "Template errors fixed, but user clarified the entire model approach is wrong. Need site-level configuration for LabEquipmentPage fields, not page-level extraction tracking. Complete redesign required - see copper-falcon_next_steps.org for detailed implementation plan."
