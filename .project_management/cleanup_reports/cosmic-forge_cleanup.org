* Summary
Enhanced the AI JSON generation pipeline with significant improvements to HTML content cleaning and field configuration organization. Successfully implemented whitespace normalization and equipment-based categorization, but content-selector association still requires refinement.

** Major Accomplishments
- Implemented comprehensive HTML cleaning (JavaScript/CSS removal, whitespace normalization)
- Reorganized field configurations by equipment categories (general_info, features_specs, accessories_options, etc.)
- Improved JSON structure with logical equipment groupings
- Enhanced content readability by normalizing whitespace display
- Maintained existing command functionality while adding new organizational features

** Key User Feedback
- Whitespace improvements were "greatly improved" ✅
- Content-selector association still not properly implemented ⚠️
- Field configurations need better alignment with their XPath selectors

* Files Modified/Created

** Enhanced Management Command
- File: `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/generate_ai_json.py`
- Lines: Complete restructure (1-287)
- Changes:
  - Added `clean_html_content()` method for JavaScript/CSS removal and whitespace normalization
  - Added `organize_field_configurations()` method for equipment-based categorization
  - Added `get_equipment_type_from_field()` method for field-to-category mapping
  - Updated JSON structure to use organized field configurations
  - Enhanced multi-value field detection

** Specific Code Improvements
- Line 14: Added `import re` for regex-based HTML cleaning
- Lines 106-122: New HTML cleaning functionality removing JS/CSS, normalizing whitespace
- Lines 124-146: Equipment-based field organization system
- Lines 148-167: Field-to-equipment category mapping
- Lines 183-194: Enhanced JSON structure with organized configurations
- Lines 224-241: Improved multi-value field support

* Reasoning
** HTML Cleaning Implementation
The previous JSON contained raw HTML with JavaScript, CSS, and encoded whitespace characters (\r\n\t), making it difficult for AI systems to process. Implemented comprehensive cleaning to:
- Remove script and style tags completely
- Strip inline JavaScript event handlers
- Normalize whitespace to readable format
- Maintain HTML structure while reducing noise

** Field Configuration Organization
Original flat structure made it difficult to understand which selectors belonged to which equipment aspects. New organization groups fields by:
- `general_info`: Basic product information (name, description, model)
- `features_specs`: Technical specifications and features
- `accessories_options`: Available accessories and options
- `media_content`: Images, videos, brochures
- `applications_uses`: Use cases and applications
- `model_variations`: Different product models
- `detailed_specifications`: Detailed spec groups
- `other_fields`: Unmapped fields

* Architecture Changes
** JSON Structure Evolution
Previous structure:
```json
{
  "extraction_config": {
    "field_name": {...}
  }
}
```

New structure:
```json
{
  "field_configurations": {
    "equipment_category": {
      "equipment_type": "category_name",
      "extraction_fields": {
        "field_name": {...}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

** Processing Metadata Updates
Enhanced metadata to include:
- `equipment_categories`: Number of equipment groupings
- `total_field_count`: Total extraction fields across all categories
- Improved content length calculation

* Issues and Incomplete Work
** CRITICAL: Content-Selector Association
- **Issue**: HTML content is not properly associated with XPath selectors
- **Impact**: AI systems cannot effectively map scraped content to extraction rules
- **Priority**: HIGH - Core functionality issue
- **Suggested Approach**: Implement content extraction preview/validation during JSON generation

** Potential Solutions for Next Model
1. **Extract Actual Content**: Apply XPath selectors to HTML during JSON generation and include extracted content samples
2. **Validation System**: Add content preview showing what each selector extracts
3. **Error Reporting**: Include selector validation results in JSON metadata
4. **Content Mapping**: Create direct associations between selectors and their extracted content

* Verification Performed
** Command Testing
- ✅ Successfully processed 2 test URLs
- ✅ HTML cleaning reduced file size and improved readability
- ✅ Equipment categorization properly organized field configurations
- ✅ Export functionality maintained compatibility
- ✅ Database operations completed without errors

** Structure Validation
- ✅ JSON structure properly organized by equipment categories
- ✅ Whitespace normalization working correctly
- ✅ Field metadata preserved (XPath selectors, comments, field types)
- ⚠️ Content-selector association needs improvement

* Context and References
** Related Documentation
- Implementation guide: `docs/ai_json_pipeline_guide.md`
- Model architecture: `apps/content_extractor/models.py`
- Command documentation: Management command help text

** User Testing Results
- Test URLs: airscience.com product category pages
- Generated JSON files: ~86-160KB per URL (reduced from original size)
- Equipment categories: 4 categories identified per test URL
- Field distribution: 7 total fields across categories

** Technical Notes
- HTML cleaning uses regex patterns for reliable content removal
- Equipment categorization supports easy addition of new field types
- Multi-value field detection enhanced with additional field types
- JSON export maintains backward compatibility

This cleanup represents significant progress in AI JSON pipeline functionality with successful HTML cleaning and organizational improvements, requiring final content-selector association refinement for complete implementation.
