* Summary
Successfully implemented specification group names field for content extractor system and created combined AI JSON processing command. Fixed field selector error and enhanced export functionality to include specification groups in both overall details and model subset files. All changes focused on automatic processing without hardcoding.

** Major Accomplishments
- Added specification_group_names field to content extractor with automatic title case formatting
- Created combined process_and_export_ai_json command for streamlined workflow
- Fixed field selector "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" error
- Removed 5-match limitation to show all extracted matches
- Enhanced specification group support in export files

** User Requirements Fulfilled
✅ Extract actual specification group names from source data
✅ Direct AI models to use ALL specification groups 
✅ Eliminate underscores and special characters automatically
✅ Ensure consistency across model batches
✅ Create combined command for generate + export in one step
✅ Show all matches instead of first 5 only
✅ Include spec groups in both overall details and model subset files

   - Enables content extractor to select and extract specification group names

2. **Migration 0010_add_specification_group_names**
   - Applied successfully to add new field option
   - No database schema changes, only choice additions

** Selectors and Interactive Components  
3. **apps/content_extractor/selectors/selection_context.py** (line ~52)
   - Added specification_group_names as multi-value field to interactive selector
   - Integrated with existing field selection interface

4. **apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py**
   - Fixed get_all_field_selections() method to handle hierarchical data structure
   - Added recursive extract_selections_from_hierarchy() function
   - Enhanced error handling for nested manager compatibility

5. **apps/content_extractor/management/commands/field_selector.py**
   - Added comprehensive error handling in _wait_for_selections() method
   - Fixed "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" error through type checking

** AI JSON Processing Commands
6. **apps/content_extractor/management/commands/generate_ai_json.py** (line 203)
   - Removed arbitrary 5-match limit: `for element in elements[:5]` → `for element in elements`
   - Now shows all extracted matches with "All matches shown" preview note

7. **apps/content_extractor/management/commands/export_ai_json.py**
   - Added extract_specification_group_names_from_record() method (lines 240-267)
   - Automatic title case conversion and deduplication
   - Enhanced model subset files with extracted_specification_groups and _specification_instructions

8. **apps/content_extractor/management/commands/process_and_export_ai_json.py** (NEW FILE)
   - Combined generate_ai_json and export_ai_json functionality
   - Two-mode processing (Overall Details + Model Subsets)  
   - Only exports most recent versions (is_current=True filter)
   - Enhanced specification group support in both file types
   - Status reporting for specification groups included

** AI Prompts and Documentation
9. **.project_management/ai_prompts/ai_json_to_lab_equipment_api.md**
   - Added "SPECIFICATION GROUP EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS" section
   - Established naming standards prohibiting underscores
   - Updated validation checklist for group name compliance

* Architecture Changes

** Specification Group Processing Flow
1. **Extraction**: specification_group_names field extracts raw group names from source content
2. **Processing**: Automatic title case conversion and underscore removal in extract_specification_group_names_from_record()
3. **Deduplication**: Unique names preserved in order during extraction
4. **Export**: Groups included in both overall details and model subset files with available_groups metadata
5. **AI Instructions**: Clear directives for exact group name usage without modification

** Two-Mode Processing Enhancement
- **Overall Details**: Contains universal fields + specification groups (no models)
- **Model Subsets**: Contains model-specific fields + specification groups + target model names
- **Batch Processing**: Splits models into configurable batches (default 4 per batch)
- **Metadata**: Complete export tracking with timestamps and processing info

** Field Selector Stability
- Fixed hierarchical data structure handling from nested_manager.export_all_selections()
- Robust error handling for data type mismatches
- Fallback mechanisms for selection extraction failures

* Key Technical Details

** Automatic Processing (No Hardcoding)
- Case correction via: `' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in clean_name.split())`
- Underscore removal: `text.replace('_', ' ').replace('-', ' ')`
- Deduplication preserves order while removing duplicates
- All processing based on actual extracted content from source data

** File Naming Patterns
- Overall Details: `{title}_overall_details_{domain}_{timestamp}.json`
- Model Subsets: `{title}_models_batch_{batch}_of_{total}_{domain}_{timestamp}.json`
- Single Batch: `{title}_models_{domain}_{timestamp}.json`

** Export Enhancements  
- extracted_specification_groups: List of unique group names with title case
- _specification_instructions: AI directives for exact group usage
- available_groups: Same as extracted_specification_groups for clarity
- Status reporting: Shows count and list of groups being included

* Testing and Verification

** Field Selector Testing
✅ Page loads without "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" error
✅ Field menu displays properly
✅ Timeout handling and browser cleanup working
✅ Hierarchical data structure compatibility confirmed

** AI JSON Generation Testing  
✅ All matches shown instead of first 5 limitation
✅ SafeFUME specification groups increased from 5 to 8 groups
✅ Model batches increased from 2 to 3 (more complete extraction)
✅ Preview notes show "All matches shown" consistently

** Combined Command Testing
✅ Command recognized by Django management system
✅ Help text displays correctly with all options
✅ Force refresh properly regenerates with updated code
✅ Specification groups included in both overall details and model subset files

* Issues Resolved

** Before Fixes
- Field selector crashed with hierarchical data structure
- Only first 5 matches shown per selector (arbitrary limitation)  
- Specification groups only in model subset files, not overall details
- No combined workflow for generate + export operations

** After Fixes
- Field selector handles nested selections robustly
- All matches displayed for complete data extraction
- Specification groups in both overall details and model subset files
- Single command workflow for end-to-end processing

* Context for Next Model

** User Requirements for Next Phase
- Create management command to combine multiple AI JSON result files
- Process combined results into new Lab Equipment Pages
- Support both overall details and model subset file formats
- Accept directory path containing files to process

** Key Files to Review
- `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/process_and_export_ai_json.py` - Combined processing workflow
- `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/export_ai_json.py` - Export logic and file structure
- AI JSON export files in `ai_json_exports/two_mode/` - File format examples

** Technical Considerations
- File naming patterns enable automatic detection and pairing
- Both overall details and model subset files contain specification groups
- Batch processing may require reassembly for complete model coverage
- Lab Equipment Page creation will need to merge overall + model data

** Architecture Foundation
The specification group names implementation provides a solid foundation for AI model consistency. The combined command streamlines the workflow, and the enhanced export structure gives the next model complete specification group context for Lab Equipment Page creation.

* Verification Commands

** Test Combined Command
```bash
python manage.py process_and_export_ai_json --domain www.airscience.com --force-refresh
```

** Verify All Matches Shown
```bash
grep "preview_note" ai_json_exports/two_mode/*_overall_details_*.json
```

** Check Specification Groups in Overall Details
```bash
grep -A 5 "extracted_specification_groups" ai_json_exports/two_mode/*_overall_details_*.json
```
