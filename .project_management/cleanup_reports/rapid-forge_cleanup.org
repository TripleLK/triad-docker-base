* HANDOFF STATUS: CORE COMPLETE - UX IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

** Mission Objective: âœ… ACHIEVED
Multi-URL testing functionality for interactive selector - CORE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

** What Works Perfectly âœ…
1. **Database Layer**: SiteConfiguration model enhanced with test_urls field and URL validation
2. **URL Switching**: Users can switch between configured test URLs during selector sessions
3. **Cross-URL Testing**: Selectors can be tested across all configured URLs automatically
4. **Admin Interface**: Test URLs can be managed through Wagtail admin interface
5. **Command Integration**: --enable-multi-url flag activates multi-URL functionality
6. **Sample Data**: airscience.com configured with 4 test URLs for immediate testing

** Critical User Experience Issues Identified ðŸ”§
Based on user feedback, two key improvements needed:

### 1. Interactive Mode Should Be Default
- **Current**: Requires `--interactive` flag to access interactive mode
- **Needed**: Interactive mode should be the default behavior
- **Impact**: Users currently need command-line knowledge for basic functionality

### 2. In-Interface URL Management Missing
- **Current**: URLs can only be added through Wagtail admin interface
- **Needed**: URL management directly within the selector interface
- **Impact**: Fragmented workflow - users must switch between admin and selector

** Technical Implementation Status
- âœ… Database models and migrations: COMPLETE
- âœ… URL switching logic: COMPLETE
- âœ… Cross-URL testing: COMPLETE
- âœ… Admin interface integration: COMPLETE
- ðŸ”§ Default interactive mode: NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- ðŸ”§ In-interface URL management: NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION

** Files Successfully Modified
- `apps/content_extractor/models.py` - Enhanced SiteConfiguration with test_urls
- `apps/content_extractor/wagtail_hooks.py` - Added Multi-URL Testing admin panel
- `apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py` - Full multi-URL support
- `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/interactive_selector.py` - Multi-URL integration
- Database migration applied successfully

** Next Model Priority Tasks

### IMMEDIATE (High Priority)
1. **Make Interactive Mode Default**
   - Remove requirement for `--interactive` flag
   - Make visual interactive mode the primary interface
   - Keep command-line mode as optional `--command` flag instead

### PRIMARY (Core Features)
2. **Add In-Interface URL Management**
   - JavaScript interface for adding new test URLs
   - Real-time validation and domain checking
   - Save new URLs directly to SiteConfiguration
   - Remove URLs from within the interface
   - Visual feedback for URL management actions

### SECONDARY (Enhancements)
3. **Streamline User Experience**
   - Unified workflow from URL discovery to testing
   - Better visual indicators for multi-URL status
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

** Architecture Notes for Next Model
The core multi-URL testing infrastructure is solid and follows the established patterns:
- Model layer handles data persistence and validation
- Service layer (InteractiveSelector) handles URL switching logic
- Interface layer provides user access
- Admin layer provides configuration management

Next model should focus on enhancing the interface layer while leveraging the existing infrastructure.

** Testing Verification
- âœ… Command `--help` shows new `--enable-multi-url` flag
- âœ… Sample data created for airscience.com
- âœ… URL switching preserves selector context
- âœ… Cross-URL testing returns comprehensive results
- âœ… Database operations work correctly

** Handoff Confidence: HIGH
Core functionality is robust and well-tested. The requested improvements are straightforward UX enhancements that build on the solid foundation already implemented.
