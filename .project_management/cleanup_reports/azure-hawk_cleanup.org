* Summary
Azure Hawk implemented robust image download functionality for the AI JSON import system, including SEO-optimized alt text handling. Fixed a critical bug with the gallery image model, ensured all images are created with proper metadata, and validated end-to-end import with SafeFUME test data.

* Files Modified/Created
- apps/base_site/utils/image_utils.py (Lines 1-180): Created, all image download and processing logic
- apps/content_extractor/management/commands/import_ai_json_to_equipment.py: Modified, image_urls and alt_text_suggestions handling
- apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py: Modified, image processing fields and logic
- .project_management/conversation_logs/azure-hawk/2025-01-22_session_log.org: Updated, session documentation

* Reasoning
- Needed robust, reusable image download and gallery creation for AI-driven imports
- Alt text is critical for SEO and accessibility; AI-generated suggestions are now used as Wagtail Image titles
- Bug fix: Removed non-existent caption field from gallery image creation

* Architecture
- All image processing logic centralized in image_utils.py
- Serializer and import command pass through image URLs and alt text
- Gallery images reference internal Wagtail Images with SEO metadata

* Issues/Concerns
- No major issues remain; all errors handled gracefully
- Future: Consider storing alt text in a dedicated field if model is extended

* Verification
- SafeFUME import: 4 images created, all with correct alt text
- Gallery images linked and sorted properly
- No errors in logs or database
