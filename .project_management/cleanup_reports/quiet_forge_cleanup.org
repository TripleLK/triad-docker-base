** Next Model Recommendations
*** Immediate Priority
   1. **Archive Historical Model Files**: Move conversation logs, cleanup reports, and next steps for all models before "Quiet Echo" to archive
      - Models to archive: Silver Mongoose through Quiet Forge (14 models total)
      - Create `.old_model_files/` directory structure
      - Preserve chronological organization for historical reference

   2. **New Sub Project Setup**: Focus on establishing new sub project infrastructure
      - Clean workspace with archived historical files
      - Fresh start for new development phase
      - Maintain streamlined cursor rules for optimal performance

*** Archive Organization Needed
   - Archive models: Silver Mongoose, Rapid Falcon, Swift Penguin, Electric Shark, Crimson Phoenix, Stellar Raven, Thunder Hawk, Silver Phoenix, Crimson Forge, Quantum Gecko, Noble Harbor, Crimson Tiger, Ancient Storm, Quiet Forge
   - Preserve: Quiet Echo forward (current working models)
   - Create systematic archive structure with date preservation

** Success Metrics
   - Target: Clean workspace ready for new sub project
   - Validation: Historical files archived but accessible
   - Outcome: Streamlined rules system operational for better model performance

** Project Health: EXCELLENT
   - Cursor rules system significantly improved
   - Model performance optimization achieved
   - Ready for new development phase with clean foundation
