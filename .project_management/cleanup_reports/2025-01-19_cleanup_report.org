* Updated Architecture

** No Structural Changes to Existing Project
   All additions were made to preserve existing Django structure:
   - Existing apps/, scripts/, html_analysis_tools/ untouched
   - Core Django files (manage.py, wsgi.py, etc.) preserved
   - Development patterns and workflows maintained

** AI Collaboration Layer Added
   New layer for AI interaction management:
   - .project_management/ :: AI-specific tracking and documentation
   - .cursor/rules/ :: IDE integration for consistent behavior
   - Root-level .org files :: Architecture and communication

** File Organization Principles
   - Respect Django conventions and patterns
   - Separate AI management from application code
   - Use established naming conventions
   - Maintain clear boundaries between systems

* MDC Conversation Context

** Original Discussion Points
   User initially requested "strict guidelines for models working on this project":
   
*** Key Requirements Identified
    1. Architecture file describing file system at all times
    2. Clean up reports with specific format and location  
    3. "Current Master Goal" document with periodic alignment checks
    4. Balance between "too much" vs "not enough" information
    5. Communication system with current thinking vs historical logs

*** MDC Files Education
    - Clarified MDC as "Markdown Components" format
    - Two primary uses: Nuxt Content and Cursor IDE rules
    - Decided on Cursor-style MDC for AI behavior rules
    - Chose org-mode for structured content (user preference)

*** System Design Philosophy
    - Architecture file as single source of truth
    - Current thinking documents stay lean and updated
    - Detailed conversation history in separate logs  
    - Clean up reports mandatory when requested
    - Communication balance between current vs historical

** Application to Triad Docker Base
   
*** Adapted Project OBSQ Model
    - Core collaboration patterns transferred successfully
    - Modified for Django web development context
    - Removed show production specific elements
    - Added web development best practices
    
*** Key Modifications for Django Context
    - Respect existing Django project structure
    - Focus on web development and data processing
    - Maintain separation between AI management and application code
    - Include database and production system protections
    - Emphasize testing and code quality practices

** User Preferences Documented
   From Project OBSQ conversation:
   - Likes org-mode for structured information
   - Values clean, consistent organization
   - Wants balance between detail and simplicity
   - Prefers modular approaches
   - Direct and collaborative communication style

* Potential Issues or Warnings

** IMPORTANT NOTE FOR NEXT AI MODEL

*** Remind User About Universal Rules Idea
    The user mentioned an idea about "setting up universal rules for these AI assisted projects" 
    during this conversation. This should be brought up with the user as a potential next step
    for expanding this framework.

*** Request Feedback Report
    Future AI models should ask the user for feedback on this AI collaboration framework
    and send back a report covering:
    
**** System Effectiveness Assessment
     - What parts of the architecture are working well
     - What could be improved or streamlined
     - User experience with the communication balance
     - Effectiveness of cleanup reports and handoffs
     
**** Universal Rules Development
     - Whether patterns from this implementation should become standard
     - What core components should be in every AI-assisted project
     - How to balance project-specific needs with universal patterns
     - Scaling considerations for multiple projects

**** Concrete Example Context
     This request comes after successfully implementing AI collaboration frameworks
     across two very different project types:
     - Project OBSQ: Live streaming production system (template-based, OBS integration)
     - Triad Docker Base: Django web application (data processing, HTML analysis)
     
     The patterns proved adaptable and effective across domains, suggesting potential
     for universal application. The user's experience managing this multi-project
     setup provides concrete data for evaluating what should become universal rules.

**** Why This Timing is Important
     - Two different project contexts successfully implemented
     - Real usage experience with the framework patterns
     - Opportunity to learn from cross-project adaptation
     - User has concrete examples to reference for feedback
     - Perfect timing to evolve from project-specific to universal patterns
