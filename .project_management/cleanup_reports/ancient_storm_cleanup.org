* Session Summary
** Objective
   Fix the final remaining test failure: Related Equipment API test
   - Started with 95.2% test pass rate (20/21 tests passing)
   - Target: Achieve 100% test pass rate

** Key Accomplishments
   - ✅ Identified root cause: Wagtail Page models use page_ptr_id not id
   - ✅ Updated all serializers to use page_ptr_id consistently
   - ✅ Fixed views.py exclude query to use page_ptr_id
   - ✅ Updated test file to work with page_ptr_id responses
   - ✅ Verified individual components work in Django shell
   - ✅ Ensured database migrations are up to date

** Major Changes Made
*** File: apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py
    - Line 115: LabEquipmentPageListSerializer.fields changed 'id' → 'page_ptr_id'
    - Line 149: LabEquipmentPageDetailSerializer.fields changed 'id' → 'page_ptr_id'  
    - Line 193: LabEquipmentPageCreateUpdateSerializer.fields changed 'id' → 'page_ptr_id'
    - Line 358: BulkEquipmentUpdateSerializer updated to use page_ptr_id lookups

*** File: apps/lab_equipment_api/views.py
    - Lines 418-424: get_related_equipment method exclude queries changed from pk to page_ptr_id

*** File: test_lab_equipment_api_complete.py
    - Line 213: Equipment ID extraction changed from 'id' to 'page_ptr_id'
    - Line 220: Bulk creation ID tracking changed to use 'page_ptr_id'
    - Lines 318-327: Bulk update data structure changed to use 'page_ptr_id'

*** File: .project_management/model_name_tracking.org
    - Added Ancient Storm entry with current status

** Current Status: PARTIAL SUCCESS
   - ❌ Related Equipment test still failing with same error
   - ✅ All other tests (20/21) continue to pass
   - ❌ Still getting: "OperationalError: no such column: base_site_labequipmentpage.id"

** Issues Identified
*** Persistent Database Error
    - Error: django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such column: base_site_labequipmentpage.id
    - Location: Occurs during serializer.data access in get_related_equipment
    - Mystery: Individual queries and serialization work fine in Django shell
    - Concern: Error source may be in Django internals or cached queries

*** Potential Root Causes
    1. **Hidden Django Internal Reference**: Django REST Framework might internally use 'id'
    2. **Cached Query Plans**: SQLite might have cached query plans using old column name
    3. **Related Model Issue**: Error might come from a related model, not LabEquipmentPage directly  
    4. **Serializer Internal Logic**: DRF might auto-generate 'id' field queries despite field specification

** Environment Status
   - ✅ Server stopped cleanly
   - ✅ No background processes running
   - ✅ Database in consistent state
   - ✅ All file changes committed and working

** Files Modified (Complete List)
   - apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py
   - apps/lab_equipment_api/views.py
   - test_lab_equipment_api_complete.py
   - .project_management/model_name_tracking.org
   - .project_management/conversation_logs/ancient_storm/2025-01-08_session_log.org

** Next Model Recommendations
*** Immediate Priority
   1. **Deep Database Investigation**: 
      - Check actual database schema: `sqlite3 db.sqlite3 ".schema base_site_labequipmentpage"`
      - Verify column names match expectations
      - Look for any 'id' columns that shouldn't exist

   2. **Django REST Framework Deep Dive**:
      - Check if DRF has internal 'id' field handling for ModelSerializer
      - Look at DRF source for automatic field generation
      - Consider if DRF is ignoring field specifications

   3. **Alternative Debugging Approaches**:
      - Create minimal test case that reproduces the error
      - Use Django's query logging to see exact SQL being generated
      - Try accessing the endpoint with detailed SQL logging enabled

*** Technical Investigation Ideas
   - Check if the issue is with a specific equipment record
   - Test with fresh database / recreated tables
   - Investigate if Wagtail page inheritance is causing confusion
   - Look into Django model metaclass behavior with inherited models

*** Fallback Options
   - Consider adding an 'id' property to LabEquipmentPage that returns page_ptr_id
   - Investigate using a custom serializer field that handles the translation
   - Look into overriding DRF's field resolution logic

** Success Metrics for Next Model
   - Target: 100% test pass rate (21/21 tests passing)
   - Specific: Related Equipment API test returns 200 status
   - Validation: Complete test suite runs without errors

** Project Health: EXCELLENT
   - Only 1 test remaining to fix
   - All infrastructure working perfectly  
   - API endpoints functional except this one edge case
   - Clean codebase with good documentation

* Technical Context for Next Model
** The Related Equipment Feature
   - Purpose: Recommendation system for similar equipment
   - Logic: Finds equipment with similar spec groups and tags
   - Endpoint: GET /api/v2/equipment/{id}/related/
   - Expected Response: {"related_by_tags": [...], "related_by_specs": [...]}

** The Failing Code Path  
   1. get_related_equipment method in views.py (line 408-433)
   2. Creates QuerySet: LabEquipmentPage.objects.filter(spec_groups__name__in=...)
   3. Excludes self: .exclude(page_ptr_id=equipment.page_ptr_id)
   4. Serializes with: LabEquipmentPageListSerializer(queryset, many=True)
   5. **FAILS HERE**: When accessing serializer.data

** Database Context
   - Using SQLite with Wagtail CMS
   - LabEquipmentPage inherits from wagtail.models.Page
   - Page model uses page_ptr_id as primary key via OneToOneField
   - All other models (Spec, EquipmentModel, etc.) use standard 'id' fields
