- **Removed** empty `scripts/` directory from root after successful consolidation

** System Integration and Verification

*** Django Functionality Testing
- **Verified** Django configuration: `python manage.py check --settings=config.settings.dev` - PASSED
- **Confirmed** all imports and settings functional after file reorganization
