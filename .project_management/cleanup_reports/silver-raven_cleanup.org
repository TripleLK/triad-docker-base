* Session Summary
  **MISSION**: Complete AIPreparationRecord model redesign to site-level configuration system
  **STATUS**: 95% Complete - Core models implemented, critical InlinePanel error blocking admin access
  **HANDOFF**: Next model must fix snippet error and implement interactive selector integration

* Major Accomplishments ✅

** Complete Model Architecture Redesign
   - ✅ Deleted incorrect AIPreparationRecord and all related models
   - ✅ Implemented SiteConfiguration model (site domain, name, metadata)
   - ✅ Implemented FieldConfiguration model (XPath selectors per LabEquipmentPage field)
   - ✅ Database migration created and applied successfully
   - ✅ Cleaned up old admin registrations and unused files

** Simplified Admin Interface
   - ✅ Replaced complex 300-line ModelAdmin with simple snippet registration
   - ✅ Eliminated custom templates and forms (user's excellent suggestion)
   - ✅ Standard Wagtail snippets interface implementation

** Files Successfully Modified
   - apps/content_extractor/models.py - Complete replacement (167 lines)
   - apps/content_extractor/wagtail_hooks.py - Snippet registration (50 lines)
   - apps/content_extractor/admin.py - Cleaned up old references
   - Database: Migration 0006 applied successfully

** Files Deleted (No Longer Needed)
   - apps/content_extractor/forms.py
   - apps/content_extractor/templates/wagtailadmin/content_extractor/upload_config.html
   - apps/content_extractor/templates/wagtailadmin/content_extractor/field_wizard.html

* Critical Issue Requiring Immediate Fix ❌

** InlinePanel KeyError in Snippet Admin
   **Error**: `KeyError: 'field_configs'` when accessing Site Configuration snippet
   **Location**: /admin/snippets/content_extractor/siteconfigurationsnippet/add/
   **Root Cause**: Proxy model setup not handling InlinePanel formset properly
   
   **Error Details**:
   ```
   File "wagtail/admin/panels/inline_panel.py", line 98, in __init__
   self.formset = self.form.formsets[self.panel.relation_name]
   KeyError: 'field_configs'
   ```

** Solution Required
   Fix proxy model configuration or use direct model registration instead of proxy models

* Next Model Priority Tasks

** IMMEDIATE (Blocking): Fix InlinePanel Error
   1. Fix snippet registration - likely remove proxy models and register base models directly
   2. Test admin interface accessibility 
   3. Verify inline field configuration editing works

** PRIMARY: Interactive Selector Integration  
   1. Connect existing interactive selector JavaScript to new SiteConfiguration models
   2. Modify selector to save XPath results to FieldConfiguration records
   3. Update workflow: select elements → save to database → ready for AI processing

** SECONDARY: Workflow Integration
   1. Create management command or view to bridge selector → configuration
   2. Test end-to-end: configure site → run selector → populate field configs
   3. Prepare for AI processing integration with LabEquipmentPage model

* Architecture Achievement
  **MAJOR SUCCESS**: Completely aligned model design with actual user workflow:
  - ❌ OLD: Page-level extraction tracking (wrong approach)
  - ✅ NEW: Site-level configuration with reusable XPath selectors
  
  **Workflow Now Supported**:
  1. Configure site domain and field XPath selectors (admin interface)
  2. Extract content from any page on that site (interactive selector)  
  3. Send structured data to AI for LabEquipmentPage JSON generation
  4. Reuse configurations across multiple pages from same site

* Technical Notes for Next Model

** Model Relationships
   ```python
   SiteConfiguration(site_domain, site_name, is_active, notes)
   FieldConfiguration(site_config, lab_equipment_field, xpath_selectors, comment)
   ```

** Database Status
   - Migration 0006 applied successfully
   - All old models removed cleanly
   - New models ready for use once admin interface fixed

** Integration Points
   - Interactive selector JavaScript: apps/content_extractor/static/js/
   - Existing test command: manage.py test_nested_selector
   - LabEquipmentPage fields defined in FieldConfiguration.LAB_EQUIPMENT_FIELD_CHOICES

* Files for Next Model Review
  - apps/content_extractor/wagtail_hooks.py (fix InlinePanel issue)
  - apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py (integration target)
  - apps/content_extractor/models.py (new models to connect to)

**HANDOFF STATUS**: Core redesign complete, ready for error fix and selector integration
