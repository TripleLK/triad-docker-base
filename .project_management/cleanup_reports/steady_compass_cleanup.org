* Session Summary
** Code Name: Steady Compass
** Session Duration: ~1 hour
** Primary Task: Debug Related Equipment API test failure

* Work Accomplished
** Successfully Identified Related Equipment Purpose
   - Related Equipment endpoint provides recommendation functionality
   - Finds equipment related by categorized tags and specification groups
   - Returns up to 5 items each for related_by_tags and related_by_specs
   - Use case: Cross-selling, recommendations, research workflows

** Reverted Major Regression
   - Initial attempts to fix Wagtail page_ptr_id issue caused major regression
   - Test pass rate dropped from 95.2% to 61.1% (7 tests failing)
   - Successfully reverted explicit ID field mappings
   - Restored to original state: 95.2% pass rate with only Related Equipment test failing

** Root Cause Confirmed
   - Error: "OperationalError: no such column: base_site_labequipmentpage.id"
   - Occurs in get_related_equipment method when querying related equipment
   - User correctly identified Wagtail uses page_ptr_id instead of direct id column
   - Issue is in the database query structure, not serializer ID mapping

* Current State
** Test Status: 95.2% Pass Rate (20/21 tests passing)
   - Total Tests: 21
   - Passed: 20
   - Failed: 1 (Related Equipment test - 500 error)

** Working Components
   - Equipment creation returns proper IDs now
   - All basic CRUD operations working
   - List, detail, search, filtering all functional
   - Authentication and permissions working

** Only Remaining Issue
   - Related Equipment endpoint returns 500 error
   - Specific problem in database query accessing non-existent 'id' column

* Files Modified This Session
** apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py
   - Added 'id' field to LabEquipmentPageCreateUpdateSerializer fields list
   - Reverted explicit id = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source='pk') mappings
   - Current state: 'id' included in all serializer fields lists

** apps/lab_equipment_api/views.py  
   - Modified get_related_equipment method exclude statements to use pk instead of id
   - Current state: .exclude(pk=equipment.pk) instead of .exclude(id=equipment.id)

* Technical Context for Next Model
** Wagtail Page Model Structure
   - Wagtail pages inherit from wagtail.models.Page
   - Use page_ptr_id as primary key internally, not direct 'id' column
   - Django's pk property maps to the correct primary key field
   - equipment.id, equipment.pk, and equipment.page_ptr_id all reference same value (confirmed via shell)

** Error Location
   - The OperationalError occurs in get_related_equipment method
   - Likely in the query: spec_groups__name__in=equipment.spec_group_names
   - The issue may be deeper in the ORM query generation or model relationships

** What's NOT the Problem
   - ID field mapping in serializers (confirmed working)
   - Basic equipment queries (all other endpoints work)
   - Authentication or permissions
   - The exclude statements (already fixed to use pk)

* Recommendations for Next Model
** Immediate Investigation
   1. Debug the exact ORM query being generated in get_related_equipment
   2. Test equipment.spec_group_names property to ensure it works correctly
   3. Investigate the spec_groups relationship on LabEquipmentPage model

** Potential Solutions to Try
   1. Simplify the related equipment query to isolate the problem
   2. Test the related_by_specs query in Django shell to see exact error
   3. Check if spec_groups foreign key relationship is properly configured
   4. Consider if the issue is in the spec_group_names property implementation

** Testing Approach
   - Current test framework is working well (test_lab_equipment_api_complete.py)
   - Focus only on the Related Equipment test - all others are passing
   - Use Django shell for query debugging before modifying code

* Handoff Notes
The project is in excellent shape with 95.2% test pass rate. Only one endpoint needs fixing, and the root cause is clearly identified. The Related Equipment feature is valuable functionality for equipment recommendations and discovery.
