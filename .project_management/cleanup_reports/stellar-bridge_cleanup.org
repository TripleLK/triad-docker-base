* Summary
Implemented AI JSON to Lab Equipment Page import system with directory-based processing. Successfully created management command that can combine AI JSON files and import them using existing API infrastructure. However, critical issue discovered: nested objects (models, specifications, features) are not being created despite no apparent errors.

* Files Modified/Created

** Created Files
*** `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/import_ai_json_to_equipment.py`
- **Purpose**: Management command to import AI JSON files into Lab Equipment Pages
- **Key Features**:
  - Auto-detects file types by JSON content (`models_data` presence)
  - Combines overall_details.json with models_batch_*.json files
  - Supports both file naming patterns and content analysis
  - Graceful error handling with intelligent messages
  - Dry-run mode for testing

** Modified Files
*** `apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py`
- **Lines Modified**: 250-420 (create method and nested creation methods)
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced `create()` method to process nested JSON data
  - Fixed `create_models()` method to handle model creation
  - Enhanced `create_specification_groups()` for spec groups
  - Enhanced `create_features()` for features
  - Added comprehensive debug logging throughout
  - Removed non-existent `model_number` field references

*** `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org`
- **Purpose**: Added "Stellar Bridge" code name entry for tracking

* Reasoning
The implementation leverages existing API infrastructure (`LabEquipmentPageCreateUpdateSerializer`) rather than creating new database logic. This ensures consistency with existing validation and creation patterns while adding support for batch JSON import.

The management command design supports both automatic detection and explicit file naming patterns, making it flexible for different AI output formats.

* Architecture Changes
** New Import Workflow
1. **Discovery**: Scan directory for JSON files
2. **Grouping**: Group files by equipment name/type
3. **Combination**: Merge overall_details with model batches
4. **Import**: Use existing API serializer for database creation
5. **Validation**: Leverage existing serializer validation

** Integration Points
- Uses `LabEquipmentPageCreateUpdateSerializer` for data validation
- Integrates with existing categorized tag system
- Respects Wagtail page hierarchy (adds to MultiProductPage)
- Uses existing model relationships and constraints

* Issues Identified
** CRITICAL: Nested Object Creation Failure
- **Problem**: EquipmentModel, SpecGroup, Feature objects not being created
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Page creation successful (✅)
  - SEO content imported (✅)
  - Categorized tags associated (✅)
  - But models count = 0 (should be 9)
  - Specification groups count = 0 (should be 3)
  - Features count = 0 (should be 7)

** Debugging Challenges
- Added extensive logging but output not appearing
- No exceptions thrown during import process
- Silent failures in nested object creation methods
- Possible transaction rollback or validation issues

** Data Structure Confirmed Working
- JSON structure is correct and complete
- File combination logic working properly
- Basic page data import successful
- Issue is specifically in nested object creation

* Testing Performed
## Command Testing
```bash
# Successful basic import
python manage.py import_ai_json_to_equipment analysis_outputs/page_jsons/SafeFUME/Claude\ 3.7\ Sonnet/ --verbose

# Dry-run testing
python manage.py import_ai_json_to_equipment analysis_outputs/page_jsons/SafeFUME/Claude\ 3.7\ Sonnet/ --dry-run
```

## Database Verification
```python
# Confirmed page creation but missing nested objects
page = LabEquipmentPage.objects.filter(title__icontains='SafeFUME').first()
page.models.count()  # Returns 0 (should be 9)
page.spec_groups.count()  # Returns 0 (should be 3)
page.features.count()  # Returns 0 (should be 7)
```

* Context for Next Model
The core import infrastructure is complete and working for basic page data. The critical blocker is that the nested object creation methods (`create_models`, `create_specification_groups`, `create_features`) are not executing properly or are failing silently.

The next model should:
1. **Immediately investigate** why the nested creation methods aren't working
2. **Focus on debugging** the transaction/validation issues
3. **Test with simpler data** to isolate the problem
4. **Add image import** once models are working properly

The foundation is solid - this is likely a specific issue with the serializer's nested creation logic or Django model relationships.
