    - .project_management/next_steps/silver-mongoose_next_steps.org

*** Session Summary
    Initial setup of AI collaboration infrastructure to enable smooth handoffs between AI models. Completed full cycle from framework definition to cleanup process.

** Model 2: Rapid Falcon
   :PROPERTIES:
   :START_DATE: [2025-01-19]
   :END_DATE: [2025-01-19]
   :SESSION_FOCUS: File Inventory and Structure Reorganization
   :STATUS: Completed
   :END:

*** Key Contributions
    - Conducted comprehensive file inventory assessment
    - Created reorganized Django project structure in triad-reorganized/
    - Successfully migrated core Django functionality to new structure
    - Enhanced AI collaboration framework with premature cutoff recovery
    - Identified Django settings configuration issue requiring resolution

*** Files Created/Modified
    - triad-reorganized/ (complete reorganized project structure)
    - .project_management/conversation_logs/rapid-falcon/2025-01-19_session_log.org
    - .project_management/cleanup_reports/rapid-falcon_cleanup.org
    - .project_management/next_steps/rapid-falcon_next_steps.org
    - .cursor/rules/02_conversation_logging.mdc (enhanced with cutoff recovery)
    - triad-reorganized/create_admin.py (attempted settings path fix)

*** Session Summary
    Successfully implemented file reorganization plan with working Django structure. Left Django settings configuration issue unresolved and file consolidation incomplete.

** Model 3: Swift Penguin
   :PROPERTIES:
   :START_DATE: [2025-01-19]
   :END_DATE: [In Progress]
   :SESSION_FOCUS: Django Settings Resolution & File Organization Completion
   :STATUS: Active
   :END:

*** Current Work
    - Resolving Django settings configuration issue preventing admin panel access
    - Completing file consolidation from root directory
    - Testing reorganized structure functionality
    - Implementing remaining organized subdirectories

* Code Name Guidelines

** Format Requirements
   - Two words: Adjective + Noun
   - Should be unrelated to current task (like Xbox gamertag)
   - Easy to remember and reference
   - Unique within project

** Examples of Good Code Names
   - Silver Mongoose
   - Blue Thunder  
   - Quiet River
   - Rapid Falcon

** Name Change Protocol
   If user requests name change:
   1. Acknowledge new name immediately
   2. Update all relevant files with new identifier
   3. Update this tracking document
   4. Reference new name in all subsequent files

* Usage in File Names
  - conversation_logs/[model-name]/
  - cleanup_reports/[model-name]_cleanup.org
  - next_steps/[model-name]_next_steps.org
