** Model [X+1]: Steady Circuit
   :PROPERTIES:
   :START_DATE: [2025-01-08]

   :START_DATE: [2025-01-08]
   :END_DATE: [2025-01-08]
   :SESSION_FOCUS: Django Ninja API Testing and Validation (Phase 4)
   :STATUS: Completed
   :END:

*** Handoff Context
    - Took over from Steady Circuit after Django Ninja implementation
    - Implemented Phase 4: Testing and Validation
    - Primary mission: Validate page_ptr_id fix with comprehensive testing
    - Secondary goal: Prepare for DRF v2 API removal

*** Key Contributions
    - Fixed critical import error (EquipmentModelSpecGroup missing from imports)
    - Resolved EquipmentModel schema field issues (removed non-existent model_number field)
    - Fixed QuoteCartItem schema field mapping (date_added vs created_at, removed notes)
    - Successfully implemented page_ptr.id solution for schema serialization
    - Validated basic API endpoints: health, test, equipment list, equipment detail all working
    - API now returns proper JSON with correct ID handling

*** Files Modified
    - apps/lab_equipment_api/ninja_schemas.py - Fixed imports and field mappings
    - api.py - Updated to use correct page_ptr/id field access patterns
    - .project_management/model_name_tracking.org

    - ✅ Health endpoint: Working
    - ✅ Test endpoint: Working  
    - ✅ Equipment list endpoint: Working (returns proper JSON with id fields)
    - ✅ Equipment detail endpoint: Working (full JSON response)
    - ❌ Related equipment endpoint: Still failing with 500 error
    
*** Critical Issue Remaining
    Related equipment endpoint (/api/v3/equipment/{id}/related) still returns 500 error.
    Root cause: Database query incompatibility with Wagtail Page inheritance.
    Error: "no such column: base_site_labequipmentpage.id"
    
    The page_ptr.id fix works for schemas but database queries need different approach.

** Model 14: Quantum Ridge
   :PROPERTIES:
   :START_DATE: [2025-01-08]
   :SESSION_FOCUS: Azure Falcon Handoff Testing & Floating UI Control Panel Implementation
   :STATUS: In Progress

    - apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py (REVIEWED) - Confirmed syntax fixes

*** Next Priorities
    1. Implement floating UI control panel (4-hour task per Stellar Rhino's roadmap)
    2. Add Save/Test/Navigate buttons to control panel
    3. Implement progress indicator for field completion
    4. Enhance existing toggle button to full control panel

*** Component Words Used
    - quantum (adjective)
    - ridge (noun)
    - Both components are unique and not used in previous models

* Code Name Guidelines

** Format Requirements
   - Two words: Adjective + Noun
   - Should be unrelated to current task (like Xbox gamertag)
   - Easy to remember and reference
   - **CRITICAL**: Must be completely unique within project

** Uniqueness Requirements
   **NEITHER the adjective NOR the noun can be reused from any previous model**
   - Check BOTH words against all previous model names before choosing
   - Even if used in different combinations, components cannot be reused
   - Example: If "Silver Mongoose" was used, you CANNOT use "Silver Pine" or "Rapid Mongoose"

** Examples of Good Code Names
   *** Natural Elements (avoiding colors)
       - Ancient River, Noble Harbor, Bright Comet, Steady Pine
       - Crystal Lake, Sacred Mountain, Gentle Valley, Deep Forest
       
   *** Abstract Concepts

   :SESSION_FOCUS: XPath Editor Field Population Bug Fix
   :STATUS: Completed
   :HANDOFF_FROM: Electric Sentinel
   :PRIORITY: CRITICAL - XPath Editor Integration Issue Resolution
   :END:

*** Key Contributions
    - Identified and fixed critical XPath field population timing issue
    - Root cause: validateXPath() overwriting currentXPath before field population
    - Solution: Moved field population before initializeEditor() with proper DOM timing
    - Resolved JavaScript boolean serialization and field population workflow
    - XPath editor integration now fully functional

*** Technical Problem Solved
    - **Issue**: XPath field remained empty despite correct currentXPath values in console
    - **Root Cause**: initializeEditor() → validateXPath() read empty input and overwrote currentXPath
    - **Fix**: Reordered execution with setTimeout to populate field BEFORE initialization
    - **Result**: Field now properly displays initial XPath values for editing

*** Files Modified
    - apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_xpath_editor.js - Fixed openEditor() timing
    - .project_management/model_name_tracking.org - Added Quantum Blazer entry
    - .project_management/conversation_logs/quantum-blazer/2025-01-08_session_log.org

*** Integration Status  
    - ✅ Arrow integration: WORKING (click ">" → editor opens)
    - ✅ Modal functionality: WORKING (UI renders correctly)
    - ✅ Field population: FIXED (textarea now shows XPath values)
    - ✅ Pattern matching: READY FOR TESTING ([X] placeholder functionality)

*** Session Summary
    Successfully resolved the blocking XPath field population issue that prevented Electric Sentinel from completing the integration. The XPath editor workflow is now fully functional - users can click arrow buttons, see the editor open with populated XPath values, and edit them properly. The foundation established by Electric Sentinel is now complete and operational.

    - Priority 2 (Un-select): ❌ NOT STARTED due to blocker
    - Priority 3 (Field Swapping): ❌ NOT STARTED due to blocker

*** Handoff Requirements
    - **IMMEDIATE**: Resolve critical field menu display issue (webdriver debugging)
    - **SECONDARY**: Validate complete draggable functionality once menu appears
    - **TERTIARY**: Continue with Priority 2 and 3 implementations per original requirements

*** Session Summary
    Successfully implemented Priority 1 draggable system with comprehensive features but encountered critical webdriver/browser issue preventing testing. Complete implementation ready for validation once underlying display problem resolved. Requires immediate technical investigation by next model.
