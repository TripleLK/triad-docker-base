* Code Name Guidelines

** Format Requirements
   - Two words: Adjective + Noun
   - Should be unrelated to current task (like Xbox gamertag)
   - Easy to remember and reference
   - Unique within project

** Examples of Good Code Names
   - Silver Mongoose
   - Blue Thunder  
   - Quiet River
   - Rapid Falcon

** Name Change Protocol
   If user requests name change:
   1. Acknowledge new name immediately
   2. Update all relevant files with new identifier
   3. Update this tracking document
   4. Reference new name in all subsequent files

* Usage in File Names
  - conversation_logs/[model-name]/
  - cleanup_reports/[model-name]_cleanup.org
  - next_steps/[model-name]_next_steps.org
