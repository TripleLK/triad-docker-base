** Model [X+1]: Steady Circuit
   :PROPERTIES:
   :START_DATE: [2025-01-08]
   :END_DATE: [2025-01-08]

** Model [X+2]: Crystal Harbor
   :PROPERTIES:
   :START_DATE: [2025-01-08]
   :END_DATE: [2025-01-08]
   :SESSION_FOCUS: Django Ninja API Testing and Validation (Phase 4)
   :STATUS: Completed
   :END:

*** Handoff Context
    - Took over from Steady Circuit after Django Ninja implementation
    - Implemented Phase 4: Testing and Validation
    - Primary mission: Validate page_ptr_id fix with comprehensive testing
    - Secondary goal: Prepare for DRF v2 API removal

*** Key Contributions
    - Fixed critical import error (EquipmentModelSpecGroup missing from imports)
    - Resolved EquipmentModel schema field issues (removed non-existent model_number field)
    - Fixed QuoteCartItem schema field mapping (date_added vs created_at, removed notes)
    - Successfully implemented page_ptr.id solution for schema serialization
    - Validated basic API endpoints: health, test, equipment list, equipment detail all working
    - API now returns proper JSON with correct ID handling

*** Files Modified
    - apps/lab_equipment_api/ninja_schemas.py - Fixed imports and field mappings
    - api.py - Updated to use correct page_ptr/id field access patterns
    - .project_management/model_name_tracking.org

*** Current Status
    - ✅ Health endpoint: Working
    - ✅ Test endpoint: Working  
    - ✅ Equipment list endpoint: Working (returns proper JSON with id fields)
    - ✅ Equipment detail endpoint: Working (full JSON response)
    - ❌ Related equipment endpoint: Still failing with 500 error
    
*** Critical Issue Remaining
    Related equipment endpoint (/api/v3/equipment/{id}/related) still returns 500 error.
    Root cause: Database query incompatibility with Wagtail Page inheritance.
    Error: "no such column: base_site_labequipmentpage.id"
    
    The page_ptr.id fix works for schemas but database queries need different approach.

* Code Name Guidelines

** Format Requirements
   - Two words: Adjective + Noun
   - Should be unrelated to current task (like Xbox gamertag)
   - Easy to remember and reference
   - **CRITICAL**: Must be completely unique within project

** Uniqueness Requirements
   **NEITHER the adjective NOR the noun can be reused from any previous model**
   - Check BOTH words against all previous model names before choosing
   - Even if used in different combinations, components cannot be reused
   - Example: If "Silver Mongoose" was used, you CANNOT use "Silver Pine" or "Rapid Mongoose"

** Examples of Good Code Names
   *** Natural Elements (avoiding colors)
       - Ancient River, Noble Harbor, Bright Comet, Steady Pine
       - Crystal Lake, Sacred Mountain, Gentle Valley, Deep Forest
       
   *** Abstract Concepts
       - Quiet Echo, Bold Quest, Wise Journey, Free Spirit
       - Pure Energy, Strong Will, Clear Vision, True Path
       
   *** Mechanical/Technical (avoiding birds)
       - Sharp Blade, Solid Gear, Smooth Engine, Heavy Anchor
       - Fine Circuit, Strong Cable, Fast Motor, Dense Core
       
   *** Weather/Natural Phenomena
       - Calm Breeze, Wild Storm, Soft Rain, Warm Sun
       - Cool Mist, Fresh Wind, Bright Dawn, Silent Snow

** Avoid These Patterns
   - Colors: Red, Blue, Silver, Golden, Crimson, etc.
   - Birds: Falcon, Eagle, Raven, Hawk, Phoenix, etc. 
   - Overused animals: Wolf, Lion, Tiger, Bear, etc.
   - Generic adjectives: Fast, Strong, Big, Small, etc.

** Name Change Protocol
   If user requests name change:
   1. Acknowledge new name immediately
   2. Update all relevant files with new identifier
   3. Update this tracking document
   4. Reference new name in all subsequent files

* Usage in File Names
  - conversation_logs/[model-name]/
  - cleanup_reports/[model-name]_cleanup.org
  - next_steps/[model-name]_next_steps.org
