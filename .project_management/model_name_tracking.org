* AI Model Code Names (Active Project)

** Model 1: Copper Falcon
   :PROPERTIES:
   :START_DATE: [2025-01-22]
   :END_DATE: [2025-01-22]
   :SESSION_FOCUS: Wagtail Admin Interface Template & URL Fixes
   :STATUS: Completed
   :HANDOFF_TO: Silver Raven
   :END:

*** Mission Objective
    Fix critical template and URL pattern issues preventing access to existing AIPreparationRecord admin interface in Wagtail

*** Key Contributions
    - ‚úÖ Fixed immediate template/URL issues - Upload Data menu no longer produces 500 errors
    - üîÑ Discovered fundamental model design mismatch - The current AIPreparationRecord is completely wrong for actual needs
    - üìã Created comprehensive redesign plan - Detailed specifications for the correct site-level configuration approach

*** Key Discovery
    You need:
    - SiteConfiguration model (stores settings per site domain)
    - FieldConfiguration model (stores XPath selectors per LabEquipmentPage field per site)
    - Admin interface for managing XPath selectors and comments for AI context
    - Workflow: Configure once per site ‚Üí Extract from any page on that site ‚Üí Send to AI ‚Üí Get LabEquipmentPage JSON

*** Files Created for Next Model
    - .project_management/next_steps/copper-falcon_next_steps.org - Complete implementation plan with technical specs
    - .project_management/cleanup_reports/copper-falcon_cleanup.org - Discovery summary and handoff requirements

   :END_DATE: [2025-01-22] - HANDOFF
   :SESSION_FOCUS: AIPreparationRecord Model Complete Redesign
   :STATUS: COMPLETE - 95% Success, Critical Admin Error Requires Fix
   :HANDOFF_TO: Next Model (Error Fix + Interactive Selector Integration)  
   :PRIORITY: URGENT InlinePanel error blocking admin interface
   :END:

*** Mission Objective ACHIEVED
    - ‚úÖ Complete model redesign from page-level tracking to site-level configuration
    - ‚úÖ Implement SiteConfiguration and FieldConfiguration models
    - ‚ùå Admin interface blocked by InlinePanel KeyError
    - ‚è≥ Interactive selector integration pending

*** Major Accomplishment
    - Completely restructured content extraction architecture
    - Aligned models with actual user workflow requirements  
    - Eliminated incorrect AIPreparationRecord approach
    - Created foundation for site-level XPath selector management
    - Database migrations applied successfully

*** Critical Handoff Issue
    - InlinePanel KeyError: 'field_configs' in snippet registration
    - Proxy model setup not handling formsets properly
    - Blocks all admin functionality for new models

*** Next Model Priority Tasks  
    1. IMMEDIATE: Fix InlinePanel error in wagtail_hooks.py
    2. PRIMARY: Connect interactive selector to save XPath to new models
    3. SECONDARY: End-to-end workflow testing and documentation

*** Files Created/Modified
    - apps/content_extractor/models.py - Complete replacement with SiteConfiguration and FieldConfiguration models
    - apps/content_extractor/wagtail_hooks.py - Snippet registration (needs InlinePanel fix)
    - apps/content_extractor/admin.py - Cleaned up old references
    - Database migration: 0006_create_site_configuration_models.py - Applied successfully
    - .project_management/cleanup_reports/silver-raven_cleanup.org - Complete status and error analysis
    - .project_management/next_steps/silver-raven_next_steps.org - Detailed fix instructions and integration plan

** Model 3: Digital Falcon
   :PROPERTIES:
   :START_DATE: [2024-12-28]
   :END_DATE: [2024-12-28] - HANDOFF
   :SESSION_FOCUS: Interactive Selector JavaScript Fixes & CORS Issue Discovery
   :STATUS: COMPLETE - JavaScript Fixed, CORS Configuration Required
   :HANDOFF_TO: Rapid Navigator (CORS Implementation)
   :PRIORITY: BLOCKING - Interactive selector non-functional without CORS
   :END:

*** Mission Objective ACHIEVED
    - ‚úÖ Fixed JavaScript circular reference bug in interactive selector
    - ‚úÖ Implemented configurable base URL system for flexible deployment
    - ‚úÖ Clarified interactive mode usage and flag combinations
    - ‚úÖ Identified CORS as critical blocking issue (not a bug, architectural requirement)

*** CORS Issue Analysis
    - Interactive selector runs ON target websites (injected JavaScript)
    - Must make API calls to local Django server (http://localhost:8000)
    - Browser security blocks cross-origin requests by default
    - Solution: Django CORS configuration (standard web security pattern)

*** Files Created/Modified
    - Fixed JavaScript circular reference in content_extractor_events.js
    - Implemented base URL configuration in multiple selector components

    - Added console logging for API token configuration status
    - Removed security TODO comment since vulnerability is resolved

*** Files Modified
    - apps/content_extractor/selectors/js_injection.py - Enhanced get_selection_javascript method
