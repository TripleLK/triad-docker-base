   :PROPERTIES:
   :START_DATE: [2025-01-22]
   :SESSION_FOCUS: Generalized XPath Selector Multi-Element Highlighting
   :STATUS: ASSIGNED
   :PRIORITY: Feature Enhancement - Multi-element XPath highlighting
   :END:

*** Mission Objective
    - Fix generalized XPath selectors to highlight ALL matching elements
    - Current issue: `features` field shows "1 selected" but should highlight all matching tabs
    - Goal: XPath patterns like `tab[X]` should find and highlight every matching tab element
    - Impact: Multi-value fields need complete visual feedback of all selected elements

*** Technical Context  
    - Comment persistence system working perfectly (Swift Phoenix completed)
    - XPath selector save/load functionality intact
    - Focus needed on `applyExistingSelectors()` element finding and highlighting logic
    - Current implementation stops at first match, needs to process all matches

*** Key Files to Examine
    - apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_events.js (`applyExistingSelectors()` function)
    - Element highlighting and badge application logic
    - XPath evaluation and result iteration patterns

*** Mission Objective
    Completely pivot away from complex parent/subfield navigation system to simplified uniform approach:
    - ALL fields use same workflow: Field click ‚Üí "How to Set" menu ‚Üí Selections interface
    - ALL fields store data as: List of XPaths (generalized) + optional comment
    - ELIMINATE: Subfield complexity, instance management, parent selection
    - IMPLEMENT: Uniform user experience for all field types

*** Strategic Direction Change
    - ‚ùå Deprecated: Complex parent/subfield architecture (Crimson Phoenix work)
    - ‚úÖ New Approach: Simplified XPath list system for all fields
    - ‚úÖ User Directive: "All fields should just go to the 'how to set' menu followed by the selections interface"
    - ‚úÖ Architecture Goal: Single workflow regardless of field complexity

*** Active Implementation Tasks
    1. **üîß CRITICAL: Update selectField() function** - Remove subfield routing, all fields use method menu
    2. **üóÇÔ∏è HIGH: Simplify data structure** - XPath list + comment storage for all fields
    3. **üé® HIGH: Implement uniform interface** - Same UI components for all field types
    4. **üßπ MEDIUM: Remove complex architecture** - Clean up subfield/instance management code

*** Files Being Modified
    - apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_events.js - Simplify selectField logic
    - apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_ui.js - Remove complex menu types
    - Database models - Update for simplified XPath storage approach
    - Templates - Unified interface components

   :STATUS: ACTIVE - Taking over from Thunder Cascade
   :HANDOFF_FROM: Thunder Cascade (Architectural Pivot Complete)
   :PRIORITY: Implement 3 user feedback priorities for streamlined workflow
   :END:

*** Mission Objective
    Take over from Thunder Cascade to implement user feedback for simplified selection functionality:
    1. Skip "How to Set" menu completely - direct field click to selections 
    2. Move comment system to selections interface (method menu bypassed)
    3. Fix broken XPath editor ">" button functionality

*** Handoff Status from Thunder Cascade ‚úÖ
    - Architectural pivot to uniform workflow COMPLETE
    - All fields route through method menu successfully
    - Comment system foundation implemented and working
    - User testing completed with specific feedback provided
    - Clear implementation roadmap with time estimates

*** Implementation Priorities
    1. **Priority 1**: Skip method menu - Direct selectField() ‚Üí startSelection() workflow
    2. **Priority 2**: Move comment functionality from method menu to selections interface
    3. **Priority 3**: Investigate and fix broken XPath editor ">" button in selections

*** Expected Outcomes
    - Streamlined 2-click workflow: Field ‚Üí Selection (no intermediate menu)
    - Comments accessible during XPath selection process
    - Full XPath editing and generalization functionality restored
    - Complete user satisfaction with simplified workflow

* PURPOSE
Track all AI model code names to ensure uniqueness and avoid component reuse.

* CURRENT MODELS

** Active Models
- **Stellar Hawk** (2025-01-22) - XPath multi-element highlighting fix

** Previous Models
- **Swift Phoenix** (2025-01-22) - Generalized XPath highlighting investigation

* Cosmic Forge
  - **Components**: Cosmic (adjective), Forge (noun)
  - **Focus**: URL management and AI JSON generation system
  - **Date**: 2025-01-22
  - **Handoff from**: Stellar Hawk (XPath highlighting system completion)

** Model 12: Thunder Nexus
   :PROPERTIES:
   :START_DATE: [2025-01-22]
   :END_DATE: [In Progress]
   :SESSION_FOCUS: AI JSON Content-Selector Association Implementation
   :STATUS: ACTIVE - Taking over from Cosmic Forge
   :HANDOFF_FROM: Cosmic Forge (AI JSON Pipeline Enhancements)
   :PRIORITY: CRITICAL - Content-selector association missing
   :END:

*** Mission Objective
    Complete the AI JSON pipeline by implementing proper content-selector association that was identified as missing by Cosmic Forge

*** Handoff Context from Cosmic Forge
    - ‚úÖ HTML cleaning (JavaScript/CSS removal, whitespace normalization) - COMPLETE
    - ‚úÖ Equipment-based field categorization - COMPLETE  
    - ‚úÖ JSON structure organization - COMPLETE
    - ‚ùå Content-selector association - CRITICAL ISSUE REMAINS
    - User feedback: "html contents were still not associated with their selectors properly"

*** Primary Task
    Implement content extraction preview during JSON generation:
    1. Apply XPath selectors to scraped HTML during JSON generation
    2. Include extracted content samples in field configurations
    3. Add XPath validation and error reporting
    4. Create direct associations between selectors and extraction results

*** Key File
    - Primary: `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/generate_ai_json.py`
    - Focus: Lines 124-194 (field organization and JSON generation methods)

** Model [Next]: Iron Catalyst
   :PROPERTIES:
   :START_DATE: [2025-01-22]
   :END_DATE: [PENDING]
   :SESSION_FOCUS: AI JSON Structure Refinements - Remove Invented Categories & Enhance Attribute Extraction
   :STATUS: ACTIVE
   :HANDOFF_FROM: Thunder Nexus
   :PRIORITY: HIGH - Structural JSON improvements for user requirements
   :END:

*** Mission Objective
    - Remove invented field categories (accessories_options, features_specs, model_variations, other_fields)
    - Implement flat JSON structure using actual LabEquipment model field names
    - Add attribute extraction for images (src), links (href), and other elements
    - Remove redundant scraped_content field from JSON output
    - Preserve existing content-selector association functionality

*** Immediate Priorities (Thunder Nexus Analysis)
    1. **CRITICAL**: Remove `get_equipment_type_from_field()` method - creates artificial categories
    2. **CRITICAL**: Enhance `extract_content_for_selectors()` to extract element attributes (src, href)  
    3. **MEDIUM**: Remove redundant `scraped_content` field from JSON structure
    4. **LOW**: Simplify overall JSON structure to flat field configuration

*** Background Context
    Thunder Nexus successfully resolved the critical content-selector association issue:
    - ‚úÖ XPath selectors now properly applied to HTML during JSON generation
    - ‚úÖ 85.7% extraction success rate achieved
    - ‚úÖ Database storage (AIJSONRecord) working correctly
    - ‚úÖ Core extraction pipeline established and validated

*** Key Files for Work
    - **Primary**: `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/generate_ai_json.py`
    - **Focus Methods**: `organize_field_configurations()`, `extract_content_for_selectors()`, `generate_ai_json_for_url()`
    - **Test Data**: Analysis outputs in `analysis_outputs/ai_json_exports/thunder-nexus/`

- Added `/delete-configuration/` API endpoint for proper selector deletion
- Fixed `applyExistingSelectors()` to prevent exponential selector multiplication  
- Enhanced `clearFieldSelections()` with backend integration
- Comprehensive testing confirmed all three critical bugs resolved

*** Files Modified:
- `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/generate_ai_json.py` (HTML extraction)
- `apps/content_extractor/views.py` (delete endpoint)
- `apps/content_extractor/urls.py` (URL routing)
- `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_events.js` (delete & multiplication fixes)

*** Status: System-critical bugs resolved, extraction quality dramatically improved
