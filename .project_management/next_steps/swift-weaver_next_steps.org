* IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES



** 1. URL Testing Infrastructure üåê
   :PROPERTIES:
   :PRIORITY: HIGH
   :ESTIMATED_TIME: 45 minutes
   :REQUIREMENT: User Requested Feature
   :END:

*** CRITICAL REQUIREMENT from User
The next model needs to implement a way to **add several URLs to the interactive selector ON THE SITE** so that selectors can be tested on multiple pages to verify they work correctly across different pages of the same domain.

*** Suggested Implementation Approach
1. **Site Configuration Enhancement**
   - Add "Test URLs" field to SiteConfiguration model
   - Allow administrators to specify multiple test URLs for each domain
   - Store as JSONField or separate TestURL model with foreign key

2. **Interactive Selector URL Menu**
   - When running interactive selector, show menu of configured test URLs
   - Allow user to switch between URLs during selection session
   - Maintain selections across URL changes within same session

3. **Admin Interface Enhancement**
   - Add inline form for managing test URLs in SiteConfiguration admin
   - Provide URL validation and accessibility checking
   - Display URL status (accessible/broken) in admin interface

4. **Testing Workflow Integration**
   - After configuring selectors on one page, offer "Test on other URLs"
   - Load each test URL and verify selectors find elements
   - Report success/failure for each URL with detailed error messages

* APPROACH STRATEGY

** Key Files to Review
- `apps/content_extractor/models.py` - Add test URL functionality to SiteConfiguration
- `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/interactive_selector.py` - URL switching logic
- `apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py` - Multi-URL support
- `apps/content_extractor/wagtail_hooks.py` - Admin interface for test URLs

** Implementation Strategy
1. **Security First**: Verify current implementation works perfectly
2. **URL Infrastructure**: Build test URL management system
3. **Interactive Integration**: Connect URL testing to interactive selector
4. **User Experience**: Make URL switching seamless and informative

* DECISIONS NEEDING INPUT

** Testing Scope
- Should URL testing be automatic or manual trigger?
- How many test URLs should be supported per domain?
- Should broken URLs be automatically disabled?

** User Interface
- In-browser URL switching menu or command-line parameter?
- Real-time selector validation or batch testing mode?
- How to display test results to user?

* HANDOFF STATUS

** Current State ‚úÖ
- **Security Implementation**: COMPLETE - Dynamic token generation fully functional
- **CORS Configuration**: COMPLETE - Cross-origin requests working
- **JavaScript Integration**: COMPLETE - Dynamic token injection working
- **Authentication**: COMPLETE - Temporary token validation working
- **Cleanup System**: COMPLETE - Graceful token cleanup on completion/interruption

** Incomplete Work
- **URL Testing System**: NOT STARTED - Critical requirement from user
- **Documentation**: INCOMPLETE - Security improvements need documentation

** Resources Available
- All security infrastructure is in place and tested
- Interactive selector framework is robust and extensible
- Admin interfaces are established and working
- Database models are flexible and ready for enhancement

** Critical Context for Next Model
The user specifically requested the ability to add and test multiple URLs within the interactive selector interface. This is essential for validating that XPath selectors work across different pages of the same domain. The security foundation is now rock-solid, so the focus can shift to this user experience enhancement.

** Files Created This Session
- Enhanced `apps/content_extractor/selectors/js_injection.py` with API token support
- Updated `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_events.js` with dynamic token usage
- Created comprehensive conversation log and tracking documentation

** Technical Foundation Ready
- APIToken model supports session tracking and expiration
- JavaScript injection system is parameterized and flexible  
- Authentication system validates both permanent and temporary tokens
- Management command infrastructure supports extensible parameters
- Interactive selector framework can be enhanced with URL management

Ready for next model to focus on URL testing infrastructure while maintaining the security improvements! üöÄ
