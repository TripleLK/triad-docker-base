* IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

** CRITICAL: Fix Content-Selector Association
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **File**: `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/generate_ai_json.py`
- **Issue**: HTML content is not properly mapped to XPath selectors
- **User Feedback**: "html contents were still not associated with their selectors properly"

** What's Working Well ✅
- HTML cleaning (JavaScript/CSS removal, whitespace normalization)
- Equipment-based field categorization 
- JSON structure organization
- Command functionality and export features

* APPROACH FOR NEXT MODEL

** Core Problem Analysis
The current implementation provides:
1. Clean HTML content in `scraped_content.html`
2. XPath selectors organized by equipment category in `field_configurations`
3. BUT no connection between the two - AI systems can't map which content each selector should extract

** Recommended Solution Strategy
Implement **content extraction preview** during JSON generation:

1. **Apply XPath Selectors to HTML**: During JSON generation, actually run each XPath selector against the scraped HTML
2. **Include Extracted Content**: Add extracted content samples to each field configuration
3. **Validation Results**: Include whether each selector found content and any errors
4. **Content Mapping**: Create direct associations between selectors and their results

** Key Implementation Steps
1. Modify `generate_ai_json_for_url()` method to include content extraction
2. Update `organize_field_configurations()` to add extracted content samples
3. Add XPath validation and error reporting
4. Enhance JSON structure to include extraction results

* KEY FILES TO REVIEW

** Primary Work File
- `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/generate_ai_json.py`
  - Focus on lines 124-194 (field organization and JSON generation)
  - The `organize_field_configurations()` method needs content extraction
  - The `generate_ai_json_for_url()` method should coordinate extraction

** Supporting Files for Context
- `apps/content_extractor/models.py` - Field configuration storage structure
- `docs/ai_json_pipeline_guide.md` - User documentation that may need updates
- Test URLs for validation:
  - https://www.airscience.com/product-category-page?brandname=purair-basic-ductless-fume-hoods&brand=8
  - https://www.airscience.com/product-category-page?brandname=purair-cagex&brand=52

** Current JSON Structure (needs enhancement)
```json
{
  "field_configurations": {
    "equipment_category": {
      "equipment_type": "category_name",
      "extraction_fields": {
        "field_name": {
          "xpath_selectors": [...],
          "comment": "...",
          "field_type": "...",
          "is_active": true
          // MISSING: extracted_content, validation_results
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* DECISIONS NEEDING INPUT

** Content Preview Scope
- Should extraction include ALL matching elements or just first match?
- How much content to include in preview (full text vs truncated)?
- Should include both raw extracted content and cleaned/processed version?

** Error Handling Strategy
- How to handle selectors that don't match any content?
- Should non-matching selectors be flagged as warnings or errors?
- Include XPath validation details in JSON or separate logging?

** Performance Considerations
- Content extraction during JSON generation will increase processing time
- Should this be optional flag or always enabled?
- Consider caching extraction results for repeated processing

* HANDOFF CONTEXT

** Current System State
- AI JSON pipeline fully functional with improved HTML cleaning
- Equipment categorization working correctly
- Export commands operational
- Database migrations applied successfully
- Test data available for validation

** User Satisfaction Level
- Whitespace improvements: "greatly improved" ✅
- Overall functionality: Working well
- Content-selector association: Still needs work ⚠️

** Technical Foundation Ready
- HTML cleaning infrastructure in place
- Field organization system established
- Command structure supports extension
- Models support content storage and versioning

** Testing Resources Available
- Working test URLs provided by user
- Existing site configurations with XPath selectors
- Export functionality for validation
- AI JSON records for comparison

* EXPECTED OUTCOME

After completing content-selector association improvements:
- AI systems receive HTML content with direct mapping to extraction rules
- Each XPath selector includes sample of what it extracts from the page
- Validation feedback shows which selectors work and which need adjustment
- Complete AI-ready JSON that enables immediate content extraction workflows

** Success Criteria
1. Generated JSON includes extracted content samples for each XPath selector
2. User confirms content is properly associated with selectors
3. AI systems can effectively use the JSON for content extraction
4. No regression in existing functionality (HTML cleaning, categorization, exports)

This represents the final step to complete the AI JSON pipeline implementation started by Stellar Hawk and enhanced by Cosmic Forge.
