* Immediate Priorities

** CRITICAL: Debug 500 Error in Django API Endpoint
**Priority**: URGENT - Core functionality broken
**Endpoint**: `/get-site-configuration/`
**Issue**: Internal Server Error preventing automatic selector loading

*** Required Actions:
1. **Check Django server logs** for detailed error traceback
   - Run Django server in debug mode
   - Monitor logs/ directory for error output
   - Check console output when API call is made

2. **Test API endpoint directly** with curl or Postman
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Token [token]" \
        "http://localhost:8000/content-extractor/get-site-configuration/?domain=www.airscience.com"
   ```

3. **Examine get_site_configuration view** in `apps/content_extractor/views.py`
   - Verify database query syntax
   - Check model imports and relationships
   - Validate authentication token handling
   - Ensure proper JSON response formatting

4. **Verify database state**
   - Check if SiteConfiguration and FieldConfiguration models exist
   - Verify sample data can be queried successfully
   - Test model relationships and foreign key constraints

** Secondary Priority: Complete End-to-End Testing
Once API endpoint is fixed, verify full workflow:
1. Automatic selector loading on page initialization
2. Visual highlighting of existing selectors
3. User notifications for pre-existing configurations
4. Proper error handling for domains without configurations

* Approach
** Key Files to Review First:
1. `apps/content_extractor/views.py` - Focus on `get_site_configuration` function
2. `apps/content_extractor/models.py` - Verify SiteConfiguration and FieldConfiguration models
3. `apps/content_extractor/urls.py` - Confirm URL pattern matches API call
4. Django server logs - Essential for error diagnosis

** Debugging Strategy:
1. **Start with server logs** - Most likely to reveal the exact error
2. **Test database queries** - Verify model relationships work
3. **Check authentication** - Ensure token validation is working
4. **Validate response format** - Confirm JSON structure matches JavaScript expectations

** Architecture Context:
The automatic selector loading infrastructure is 95% complete:
- ‚úÖ Frontend JavaScript functions (`loadExistingSelectors`, `applyExistingSelectors`)
- ‚úÖ Automatic invocation timing (1-second delay after initialization)
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback system (highlighting and notifications)
- ‚úÖ Error handling and logging throughout
- ‚ùå Backend API endpoint returning 500 errors

* Decisions
** No User Input Required
All necessary decisions have been made:
- Multi-URL management system completely eliminated
- Clean site-level configuration architecture established
- Automatic loading approach confirmed working

** Technical Decisions Made:
1. **Single-domain focus**: Each SiteConfiguration handles one domain
2. **Field-level granularity**: Each FieldConfiguration stores one XPath per field
3. **Automatic loading**: Triggered 1 second after page initialization
4. **Visual feedback**: Dashed border highlighting for existing selectors

** Next Model Autonomy:
Next model has full autonomy to debug and fix the backend API endpoint without requiring user consultation.

* Handoff
** Current State:
- **Codebase**: Clean, focused architecture with multi-URL legacy code eliminated
- **Frontend**: Fully functional selector loading system ready for backend API
- **Backend**: API endpoint broken with 500 errors - requires immediate debugging
- **Database**: Models exist but API queries failing

** Incomplete Work:
1. **CRITICAL**: 500 error in `/get-site-configuration/` endpoint
2. **Testing**: End-to-end workflow verification pending API fix
3. **Documentation**: Technical documentation updates for new architecture

** Resources Available:
- **Conversation Log**: Complete session history in `.project_management/conversation_logs/neon-dragon/2025-01-22_session_log.org`
- **Cleanup Report**: Detailed changes and reasoning in `.project_management/cleanup_reports/neon-dragon_cleanup.org`
- **Model Tracking**: Updated status in `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org`

** Technical Context for Next Model:
The automatic selector loading feature was originally implemented by Electric Sentinel with excellent infrastructure:
- `loadExistingSelectors()` - Fetches configuration via `/get-site-configuration/` API
- `applyExistingSelectors()` - Applies XPath selectors to DOM elements  
- `highlightExistingElement()` - Provides visual feedback with dashed borders
- `showExistingSelectorNotification()` - Shows user-friendly notifications

Neon Dragon added automatic invocation in `js_injection.py` but discovered the backend API endpoint fails with 500 errors, preventing the entire system from working despite having all the correct infrastructure.

** Error Evidence:
Browser console shows:
```
üîÑ Loading existing selectors for domain: www.airscience.com
‚ùå Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
‚ùå Error loading existing selectors: Error: HTTP 500: Internal Server Error
```

The next model needs to focus immediately on Django backend debugging to resolve this critical blocker.

* Success Criteria
** Immediate Success:
- `/get-site-configuration/` API endpoint returns 200 status
- JSON response contains field mappings for configured domains
- Browser console shows successful selector loading

** Complete Success:
- Automatic selector loading works on page load
- Visual highlighting appears for existing selectors
- User notifications display for pre-existing configurations
- System gracefully handles domains without configurations

** Verification Steps:
1. Test API endpoint with curl - should return 200 and JSON data
2. Load a page with existing selectors - should auto-highlight elements
3. Load a page without selectors - should show "no existing selectors" message
4. Check browser console - should show successful loading logs

The next model should achieve immediate success (fixing the 500 error) as the top priority, which will enable complete success of the automatic selector loading feature.
