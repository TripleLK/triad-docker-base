* IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Fix Sub-menu Navigation

** Issue Summary
- Draggable functionality ‚úÖ WORKING PERFECTLY (user confirmed)
- Field menu display ‚úÖ WORKING 
- Selection exclusion ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Sub-menus NOT opening** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE

** Root Cause Analysis
The JavaScript correctly detects nested fields and sets pending actions, but the Python backend isn't processing these actions to switch contexts and refresh the UI.

** Technical Details

*** JavaScript Behavior (Working)
```javascript
// In startFieldSelection() - this works correctly
if (field && field.has_sub_fields) {
    window.contentExtractorData.pendingAction = {
        type: 'enter_nested_field',
        fieldName: fieldName,
        instanceIndex: 0,
        timestamp: Date.now()
    };
    showTemporaryNotification(`üîÑ Entering nested context: ${fieldName}`, 'info');
}
```

*** Python Backend (Needs Investigation)
```python
# These methods exist but connection unclear:
def poll_for_nested_actions(self, timeout: float = 30.0) -> bool  # Line 3119
def check_for_nested_actions(self) -> bool                       # Line 2938  
def enter_nested_field(self, field_name: str, instance_index: int = 0) -> bool  # Line 2837
```

** Debugging Steps for Next Model

*** Step 1: Verify Polling is Active
- Check if `poll_for_nested_actions()` is being called during field menu display
- Add debug logging to see if pending actions are detected
- Verify JavaScript `pendingAction` is being read by Python

*** Step 2: Test Action Processing  
- Manually trigger `enter_nested_field()` to confirm it works
- Check if context switching updates `self.context_stack`
- Verify breadcrumb data is properly updated

*** Step 3: Fix UI Refresh Chain
- Ensure `enter_nested_field()` calls JavaScript `refreshNestedInterface()`  
- Confirm new field options are loaded for sub-context
- Test that menu rebuilds with sub-fields

*** Step 4: End-to-End Testing
- Click nested field in menu
- Verify console shows "Field has sub-fields, entering nested context"
- Confirm Python detects the action
- Test that sub-menu appears with nested fields
- Validate breadcrumb navigation

** Expected Flow
1. User clicks nested field (üèóÔ∏è) ‚Üí JavaScript sets `pendingAction`
2. Python polling detects action ‚Üí calls `enter_nested_field()`
3. Context switches ‚Üí `refreshNestedInterface()` called  
4. New menu displays ‚Üí sub-fields shown with breadcrumbs

** Files to Focus On
- **Primary**: `apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py`
  - Lines 2837-2869: `enter_nested_field()` method
  - Lines 2938-2972: `check_for_nested_actions()` method  
  - Lines 3119-3151: `poll_for_nested_actions()` method

** Test Cases Needed
- [ ] Nested field detection and action setting
- [ ] Python polling and action processing  
- [ ] Context switching and state management
- [ ] UI refresh and sub-menu display
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation functionality

** Success Criteria
- Clicking nested fields opens sub-menus
- Breadcrumb navigation appears and functions
- Context depth tracking works correctly
- Can navigate back to parent contexts
- No regression in existing functionality

** Current Status Context
- System is 95% complete and highly functional
- All major UX features working (dragging, selection, scrolling)
- Only this isolated navigation issue remains
- Clean codebase with no technical debt

This is a well-defined debugging task focused on connecting existing JavaScript and Python components.
