* Turn 1: Image Download Implementation

  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Received seamless handoff from Crimson Cipher to implement image download functionality for AI JSON import system. Crimson Cipher successfully updated the AI conversion prompt to extract image URLs from gallery_images HTML and generate both image_urls and alt_text_suggestions fields. The test data (SafeFUME equipment) shows proper extraction with URLs like:

- https://www.airscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PDT_CA30T_Front_Open.png

** Changes Made

*** Created apps/base_site/utils/image_utils.py (Lines 1-158)
- download_image_from_url(): Core function to download images from URLs and create Wagtail Image objects
- process_image_urls(): Processes lists of URLs with alt text and base URL conversion
- create_gallery_images(): Creates LabEquipmentGalleryImage objects from downloaded images
- Includes proper error handling, timeout management, and duplicate image detection

*** Modified apps/content_extractor/management/commands/import_ai_json_to_equipment.py
- combine_json_data_for_api() method: Added image_urls and alt_text_suggestions processing
- Extracts base URL from source_url for relative URL conversion
- Passes image data through to serializer

*** Modified apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py
- LabEquipmentPageCreateUpdateSerializer: Added image_urls and base_url fields
- create() method: Added image processing extraction and process_images() call
- process_images() method: Integrates with image_utils to download and create gallery images
- Graceful error handling - page creation continues even if images fail

** Rationale
The implementation follows the exact plan outlined in Crimson Cipher's next steps:
1. Image utility module for HTTP downloads and Wagtail Image creation
2. Import command updates to process image_urls from AI JSON  
3. Serializer enhancement to handle image downloading during page creation

The system is designed for robustness - image failures don't prevent page creation, and duplicate detection prevents unnecessary downloads.

** Next Steps Identified
- Test with SafeFUME data to verify end-to-end functionality
- Validate that images appear in Wagtail admin and frontend gallery
- Monitor download performance and error handling

* Turn 2: Alt Text SEO Implementation & Bug Fixes
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User clarified requirement for alt text handling - wanted SEO-optimized alt text on Wagtail Image objects themselves (not captions), using the alt_text_suggestions from AI JSON output. Fixed critical bug where LabEquipmentGalleryImage model doesn't have a caption field, which was causing image creation failures.

** Changes Made

*** Enhanced apps/base_site/utils/image_utils.py
- Updated download_image_from_url() to accept alt_text parameter for SEO
- Enhanced process_image_urls() to pass alt text suggestions to image creation
- Fixed create_gallery_images() to remove non-existent caption field
- Alt text now stored as image.title for proper SEO indexing

*** Fixed Model Field Error
- Removed caption field assignment that doesn't exist on LabEquipmentGalleryImage
- LabEquipmentGalleryImage only has: internal_image, external_image_url, is_fallback
- Alt text properly stored in Wagtail Image.title field for SEO purposes

** Testing Results
*** Image Creation Success ✅
- 4 images successfully downloaded and created
- SEO alt text examples:
  - "SafeFUME CA30S cyanoacrylate fuming chamber right side view for fingerprint development"
  - "SafeFUME CA30T cyanoacrylate fuming chamber with front door open showing interior chamber"
  - "SafeFUME CA60T large cyanoacrylate fuming chamber left side view for forensic applications"
  - "SafeFUME CA30S standard cyanoacrylate fuming chamber for latent fingerprint processing"

*** Gallery Integration ✅
- All 4 gallery images properly linked to SafeFUME page
- Correct sort order maintained (0, 1, 2, 3)
- Internal image references working correctly

** Rationale
- Alt text stored in Wagtail Image.title provides proper SEO indexing
- Eliminates model field mismatch that was preventing image creation
- AI-generated alt text suggestions are descriptive and SEO-optimized
- System now properly handles both image download and SEO metadata

** Implementation Complete
The image download functionality is now fully operational:
1. ✅ HTTP image downloading with proper error handling
2. ✅ SEO alt text extraction and application
3. ✅ Wagtail Image object creation with metadata
4. ✅ Gallery image association with equipment pages
5. ✅ Graceful error handling and duplicate prevention
