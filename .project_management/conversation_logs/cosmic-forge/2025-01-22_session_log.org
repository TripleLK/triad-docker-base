* Turn 1: Handoff Reception and System Testing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 14:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Received handoff from Stellar Hawk with comprehensive next steps document for AI JSON pipeline implementation. Established code name "Cosmic Forge" and updated model tracking. User requested testing of actual management commands with working URLs.

** Changes Made
- Updated `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org` with Cosmic Forge entry
- Updated `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org` to mark AI JSON pipeline as completed

** Rationale
Needed to establish identity and understand current system state before proceeding with testing.

** Next Steps Identified
Test management commands with real URLs to verify functionality.

* Turn 2: Initial Command Testing Setup
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 14:45:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User provided actual working URLs to replace placeholder test URLs. Began testing import_site_urls and generate_ai_json commands with real airscience.com URLs.

** Changes Made
- Created and updated `test_urls.txt` with real working URLs:
  - https://www.airscience.com/product-category-page?brandname=purair-basic-ductless-fume-hoods&brand=8
  - https://www.airscience.com/product-category-page?brandname=purair-cagex&brand=52

** Rationale
Real URLs were needed to properly test the command functionality and verify data processing.

** Next Steps Identified
Execute and validate all management commands with actual data.

* Turn 3: Comprehensive Command Testing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 15:00:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Successfully tested complete AI JSON pipeline:
- URL import (dry-run and actual)
- AI JSON generation 
- Export functionality (CSV and individual JSON)
- Verified generated content structure and metadata

** Changes Made
- Imported 2 URLs to database via import_site_urls command
- Generated AI JSON records via generate_ai_json command
- Created test exports in `./test_exports` directory
- Verified JSON structure and content size (160KB and 207KB files)

** Rationale
Comprehensive testing validated that all command functionality works correctly with real data.

** Next Steps Identified
Review JSON structure for improvement opportunities based on user feedback.

* Turn 4: User Feedback on JSON Structure Issues
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 15:15:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User identified two critical issues with generated JSON:
1. Field configurations not properly grouped with their target content
2. HTML content needs cleaning (remove JavaScript/CSS, normalize whitespace)

User requested improvements to make JSON more AI-friendly.

** Changes Made
None in this turn - assessment and planning phase

** Rationale
User feedback identified specific structural and content quality issues requiring code modifications.

** Next Steps Identified
Implement HTML cleaning and field configuration reorganization.

* Turn 5: AI JSON Pipeline Enhancement Implementation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 15:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Implemented major improvements to `generate_ai_json.py` command:
- Added comprehensive HTML cleaning (JavaScript/CSS removal, whitespace normalization)
- Reorganized field configurations by equipment categories
- Enhanced JSON structure with logical groupings

** Changes Made
- File: `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/generate_ai_json.py` (lines 1-287)
- Added `clean_html_content()` method for HTML processing
- Added `organize_field_configurations()` method for equipment-based categorization
- Added `get_equipment_type_from_field()` method for field mapping
- Updated JSON structure to use organized field configurations
- Enhanced multi-value field detection

** Rationale
User feedback indicated HTML content was difficult for AI systems to process due to JavaScript/CSS and encoded whitespace. Field configurations needed logical organization by equipment type.

** Next Steps Identified
Test enhanced functionality and verify improvements meet user requirements.

* Turn 6: Enhanced Command Testing and User Feedback
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 15:45:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Tested updated AI JSON generation with force refresh. User provided feedback:
- Whitespace improvements were "greatly improved" ✅
- Content-selector association still not working properly ⚠️
- User requested cleanup protocol rather than continuing fixes

** Changes Made
- Regenerated AI JSON with enhanced cleaning and organization
- Exported updated JSON files for verification
- Cleaned up test files and exports
- Verified improved structure and content quality

** Rationale
Testing confirmed whitespace improvements but revealed content-selector association still needs work. User satisfaction with partial improvements but wants handoff for remaining issue.

** Next Steps Identified
Execute cleanup protocol and prepare handoff for content-selector association fix.

* Turn 7: Cleanup Protocol Execution
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:00:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested cleanup protocol execution due to remaining content-selector association issue. Successfully implemented whitespace cleaning and equipment categorization but content mapping still needs refinement.

** Changes Made
- Created `.project_management/cleanup_reports/cosmic-forge_cleanup.org` - comprehensive cleanup report
- Created `.project_management/next_steps/cosmic-forge_next_steps.org` - detailed next steps for content-selector association
- Archived temporary files to `.old_temporary_files/cosmic-forge/`
- Updated conversation log with complete session documentation

** Rationale
User identified that while improvements were successful, the core content-selector association issue requires dedicated focus. Cleanup protocol provides thorough documentation for seamless handoff.

** Next Steps Identified
Prepare handoff message and execute git automation for next model to address content-selector association.

* Summary of Major Accomplishments
- Enhanced AI JSON pipeline with HTML cleaning and equipment categorization
- Successfully tested all management commands with real data
- Implemented comprehensive whitespace normalization
- Created logical field configuration organization
- Maintained backward compatibility and command functionality
- Documented critical remaining issue for next model

* Critical Handoff Information
