* Turn 1: Git Script Creation and File Organization
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [15:10:00]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User requested creation of git cleanup script for AI sessions with push to separate branch (not main)
   - Successfully created and tested comprehensive git script with shared branch strategy
   - Completed major file organization from Swift Penguin's next steps 
   - User clarified that "test" files were development testing, not actual unit tests - moved to archive instead

** Changes Made
   - Created `scripts/git_cleanup_push.py` - Comprehensive git script for AI session management
     * Features: shared `ai-work` branch, smart file selection, model names in commits, safety features
     * Fixed filename parsing bug during development and testing
   - Created organized directory structure in `triad-reorganized/`:
     * `scripts/` with `equipment_scrapers/`, `data_import/`, `analysis/`
     * `tests/` with `unit/`, `integration/`, `fixtures/` (empty, ready for real tests)
     * `docs/` with `api/`, `deployment/`, `equipment_integration/`
     * `data/` with `selectors/`, `sample_payloads/`, `reference/`
     * `analysis_outputs/` with `archived/`, `current/`
     * `archive/` with `development_testing/`

** File Movements Completed
   - **Scripts organized:**
     * `verify_api_page.py` → `scripts/equipment_scrapers/`
     * `get_token.py` → `scripts/data_import/`
     * `fix_html.py` → `scripts/analysis/`
     * `check_*.py` files (4 files) → `scripts/analysis/`
   - **Data files organized:**
     * `adam_equipment_selectors.json` → `data/selectors/`
     * `equipment_payload.json` → `data/sample_payloads/`
   - **Development testing archived:**
     * `test_api_client_direct.py` → `archive/development_testing/`
     * `test_lab_equipment_api.py` → `archive/development_testing/`
     * `test_specs.py` → `archive/development_testing/`
     * `test_triad_selectors.py` → `archive/development_testing/`
     * `test_*.json` files (3 files) → `archive/development_testing/`
   - **Analysis outputs archived:**
     * `comparison_output_20250604_130330/` → `analysis_outputs/archived/`
     * `comparison_test_20250604_122846/` → `analysis_outputs/archived/`
     * `airscience_*_comparison_*/` directories (4 total) → `analysis_outputs/archived/`

** Rationale
   - **Git Script Creation**: User needed automated way to commit and push AI work without affecting main branch
   - **Shared Branch Strategy**: More efficient than per-model branches since each model typically runs script once
   - **Model Names in Commits**: Ensures clear attribution of work to specific AI models
   - **Archive vs Tests**: User clarified that existing "test" files were development testing, not unit tests
   - **Systematic Organization**: Following Swift Penguin's detailed file mapping plan for consistency

** Cross-References
   - Built on Swift Penguin's next steps: `.project_management/next_steps/swift-penguin_next_steps.org`
   - Django structure foundation: `.project_management/cleanup_reports/swift-penguin_cleanup.org`
   - File organization roadmap: `.project_management/cleanup_reports/rapid-falcon_cleanup.org`

** Git Integration Success
   - Successfully created and committed git script to `ai-work` branch
   - Script handles: branch creation/switching, smart file selection, commit messages, push to remote
   - Tested and working with proper filename parsing and error handling

** Progress Assessment
   **MAJOR COMPLETION**: Directory structure creation and systematic file organization from Swift Penguin's next steps
   - ✅ Directory structure created (Priority 1)
   - ✅ High-priority file consolidation completed (Priority 2 partial)
   - ✅ Development testing files properly archived
   - ✅ Analysis output directories organized
   - ✅ Git workflow established for future AI sessions

** Files Ready for Next Phase
   - Root directory significantly cleaner with ~15 files moved to organized locations
   - Development testing separated from future real test development
   - Clear structure ready for continued development work
   - Git script ready for use by future AI models
