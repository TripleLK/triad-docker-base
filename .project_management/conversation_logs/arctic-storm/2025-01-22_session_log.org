* Turn 1: Critical System Fixes
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:00:37
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User reported three critical issues with the content extraction system:
1. Extracted JSON missing actual HTML content (only text)
2. Delete functionality (red X button) not working - doesn't remove selectors from backend
3. Selector multiplication bug - generalized XPaths saved multiple times (multiplying by match count)

Evidence: SafeFUME URL showing features field with 16 identical `//div[starts-with(@id, "tab")]` selectors instead of just one.

** Changes Made

*** Enhanced HTML Content Extraction
File: `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/generate_ai_json.py`
- Lines 180-250: Completely rewrote `extract_content_for_selectors()` function
- Added full HTML extraction using `etree.tostring(element, encoding='unicode', method='html')`
- Enhanced content extraction to include text, HTML, AND attributes
- Now extracts complete DOM structure preserving all HTML markup

*** Added Delete Configuration Endpoint  
File: `apps/content_extractor/views.py`
- Lines 350-430: Added `delete_xpath_configuration()` view function
- Supports deleting specific XPath selectors or all selectors for a field
- Properly deactivates field configurations when no selectors remain
- Includes comprehensive error handling and validation

File: `apps/content_extractor/urls.py`
- Line 20: Added delete-configuration endpoint URL pattern

*** Fixed Selector Multiplication Bug
File: `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_events.js`
- Lines 67-150: Fixed `applyExistingSelectors()` function
- Changed from creating one selection per matched element to one selection per unique XPath
- Properly highlights all matching elements while storing only one selector entry
- Prevents exponential multiplication of identical XPath selectors

*** Enhanced Delete Button Functionality
File: `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_events.js`
- Lines 934-980: Enhanced `clearFieldSelections()` function
- Added backend API call to `/delete-configuration/` endpoint
- Properly deletes from both frontend state and backend database
- Added success/error feedback with visual notifications

** Rationale
These were critical bugs breaking the core functionality of the system:
- Missing HTML made extracted data incomplete for AI processing
- Non-functional delete buttons caused accumulation of unwanted selectors  
- Multiplication bug created exponentially growing, duplicated selector lists

** Verification Results
- Re-ran SafeFUME extraction showing complete HTML content in JSON output
- Confirmed delete endpoint working with proper authentication
- Fixed selector loading to prevent multiplication on page reload

** Next Steps Identified
- Test delete functionality in live browser interface
- Verify selector multiplication fix by reloading configured pages
- Monitor extraction quality with enhanced HTML content inclusion

** Cross-References
- Previous Steel Phoenix session logs showing enhancement requests
- SafeFUME test data in `ai_json_exports/individual/` directory
- Model tracking updated with Arctic Storm code name 

* Turn 2: Enhanced Delete Strategy
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:10:15
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User pointed out better approach for delete functionality: instead of immediate backend deletion when red X is clicked, handle deletions when "Finish" button is clicked (consistent with save workflow).

** Changes Made

*** Improved Delete Strategy (`content_extractor_events.js`):
- Reverted `clearFieldSelections()` to clear locally only
- Added `fieldsToDelete` tracking set to mark fields for deletion
- Enhanced `saveConfigurationsToBackend()` to handle deletions first before saves
- Local clear shows yellow notification: "cleared locally - click 'Finish' to save changes"
- Maintains consistency with existing save workflow

*** Technical Implementation:
- `window.contentExtractorData.fieldsToDelete` tracks cleared fields
- `Promise.all()` handles multiple field deletions before proceeding with saves
- Clear feedback distinguishes between local action and backend commit
- Deletion promises resolve before save operations begin

** Rationale
This approach provides:
- **Consistency**: All backend changes happen on "Finish" click
- **User Control**: Can clear locally and change mind before committing
- **Performance**: Fewer API calls during selection process
- **Clarity**: Obvious distinction between local actions and backend commits

** Next Steps Identified
- Test the complete delete workflow with multiple fields
- Verify Clear All button (if exists) uses same pattern
- Document the enhanced workflow pattern for future development
