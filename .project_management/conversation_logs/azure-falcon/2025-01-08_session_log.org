* Turn 1: Critical JavaScript Syntax Error Resolution
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 14:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Digital Wolf completed Phase 1 tasks (field cleanup, Ctrl+Click implementation, UI updates) but introduced critical JavaScript syntax errors preventing file import. F-string template literals had inconsistent curly brace escaping - some braces properly doubled `{{}}`, others single `{}`, breaking Python syntax at line 632.

** Changes Made
- Fixed JavaScript template literal syntax in `apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py` lines 632-698
- Corrected all single braces `{` to doubled braces `{{` for Python f-string compatibility  
- Ensured consistent brace escaping throughout JavaScript code blocks
- Verified Python syntax validation with py_compile

** Rationale
The JavaScript code is embedded within Python f-strings, requiring all literal braces to be doubled to escape them properly. Single braces cause Python interpreter to expect variable interpolation, resulting in syntax errors.

** Next Steps Identified
- Continue with floating UI control panel implementation (4 hour task)
- Implement multi-instance selection logic (6 hour task)  
- Create text input modal system
- Follow Stellar Rhino's detailed Phase 1 roadmap

** Technical Status
- âœ… JavaScript syntax errors resolved - file now imports successfully
- âœ… Field list cleanup completed (AI-specific fields removed)
- âœ… Ctrl+Click implementation completed with modifier key detection
- âœ… Alt+Click preview mode with visual feedback
- âœ… User interface instruction updates completed
- ðŸ”„ Phase 1 continues with floating UI panel implementation

- Links to Digital Wolf's work and Stellar Rhino's next steps documentation
- Continuation of multi-selector enhancement per handoff requirements 

* Turn 2: Full Cleanup Protocol Execution
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 15:00:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested full cleanup. Executed complete cleanup protocol including cleanup report generation, next steps documentation, and preparation for git automation handoff.

** Changes Made
- Created `.project_management/cleanup_reports/azure-falcon_cleanup.org` (comprehensive cleanup report)
- Created `.project_management/next_steps/azure-falcon_next_steps.org` (detailed handoff guidance)
- Updated conversation log with cleanup completion summary
- Prepared handoff documentation with immediate priorities and technical context

** Rationale
Following established cleanup protocol ensures seamless handoff to next model with complete documentation of work accomplished, issues resolved, and clear priorities for Phase 1 continuation.

** Cleanup Status
- âœ… Cleanup report generated with technical analysis and verification results
- âœ… Next steps file created with detailed implementation roadmap
- âœ… Conversation log finalized with complete session documentation
- ðŸ”„ Ready for git automation and handoff to next model
