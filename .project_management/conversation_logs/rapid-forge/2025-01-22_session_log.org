* Turn 1: Multi-URL Testing Implementation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 2025-01-22
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Taking over from Swift Weaver to implement multi-URL testing functionality for the interactive selector interface. The goal is to allow users to easily assess whether chosen selectors work across multiple pages on the same site by adding URL switching capabilities to the interactive selector.

** Changes Made

*** Database Layer Enhancements
- Enhanced SiteConfiguration model in `apps/content_extractor/models.py`:
  - Added `test_urls` JSONField with default=list
  - Added URL validation and management methods:
    - `add_test_url(url)` - validates domain and adds URL
    - `remove_test_url(url)` - removes URL from list
    - `get_valid_test_urls()` - returns properly formatted URLs
    - `test_urls_count` property for admin display
- Created database migration `0007_delete_fieldconfigurationsnippet_and_more.py`
- Applied migration successfully

*** Admin Interface Updates
- Enhanced `apps/content_extractor/wagtail_hooks.py`:
  - Added "Multi-URL Testing" panel to SiteConfiguration admin
  - Added helpful help text for test URL management
  - Maintained existing functionality while adding new features

*** Interactive Selector Enhancements
- Enhanced `apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py`:
  - Updated constructor with multi-URL parameters:
    - `enable_multi_url: bool = False`
    - `site_config = None`
    - `test_urls: list = None`
  - Added URL switching methods:
    - `switch_to_url(url)` - switch to specific URL with validation
    - `switch_to_next_url()` - cycle to next URL in list
    - `switch_to_previous_url()` - cycle to previous URL in list
  - Added testing methods:
    - `test_current_selectors_on_all_urls()` - test selectors across all URLs
    - `_test_xpath_on_current_page()` - test individual XPath on current page
  - Added information methods:
    - `get_available_test_urls()` - get list of test URLs
    - `get_current_url_info()` - get current URL context info

*** Management Command Updates
- Enhanced `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/interactive_selector.py`:
  - Added `--enable-multi-url` command line flag
  - Added site configuration detection from URL
  - Added visual feedback showing available test URLs
  - Enhanced constructor call with multi-URL parameters
  - Added `_get_site_configuration_and_test_urls()` method for URL matching

*** Sample Data Creation
- Created and ran setup script to create sample SiteConfiguration:
  - Site: Air Science USA (airscience.com)
  - Added 4 test URLs for different product categories
  - Configured for immediate testing of multi-URL functionality

** Rationale
The multi-URL testing functionality addresses a critical need for users to validate that their XPath selectors work consistently across different pages of the same website. This is essential for robust content extraction since:

1. **Selector Validation**: Users can immediately see if their selectors work on multiple pages
2. **Quality Assurance**: Reduces the risk of selectors that only work on one specific page
3. **Efficiency**: Allows testing multiple URLs without manually navigating and re-configuring
4. **User Experience**: Provides seamless URL switching while preserving selection context

** Technical Architecture
The implementation follows a layered approach:
- **Model Layer**: SiteConfiguration stores test URLs with validation
- **Service Layer**: InteractiveSelector provides URL switching and testing logic
- **Interface Layer**: Management command provides user-friendly access
- **Admin Layer**: Wagtail interface for URL management

** Next Steps Identified
1. End-to-end testing with real selector creation and URL switching
2. Potential JavaScript interface enhancements for browser-based URL switching
3. Documentation of the multi-URL testing workflow
4. Performance optimization for sites with many test URLs

** Cross-References
- Model tracking: `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org` - Updated with Rapid Forge entry
- Previous work: Swift Weaver implemented dynamic API token generation
- Architecture: Enhanced site configuration system from Silver Raven's foundation

* Turn 2: User Feedback and Handoff Requirements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 2025-01-22
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Received user feedback identifying two key improvements needed for the multi-URL testing functionality:

1. **Interactive Mode Default**: Currently requires `--interactive` flag, should be the default behavior
2. **In-Interface URL Management**: Currently URLs can only be added through Wagtail admin, need ability to add URLs from within the selector interface

** Issues Identified
- Multi-URL testing functionality is complete but UX needs refinement
- Users shouldn't need command-line flags for basic interactive functionality
- URL management workflow is fragmented between admin interface and selector

** Next Model Priority Tasks
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Make interactive mode the default behavior in management command
2. **PRIMARY**: Add URL management capabilities within the selector interface
   - Add URL input functionality to JavaScript interface
   - Implement real-time URL addition/removal
   - Update SiteConfiguration from within the selector
3. **SECONDARY**: Streamline the overall user experience workflow

** Status
Multi-URL testing core functionality is COMPLETE and working. Handoff focuses on UX improvements and workflow streamlining.
