* Session Overview
** Handoff Context
Received successful handoff from Stellar Phoenix with validated nested object selection architecture.
User testing confirmed: "nested menus worked very well!"

** Current Mission
Implement three user-defined UI enhancement priorities:
1. **PRIORITY 1**: Draggable menu system - all UI elements draggable with default starting positions
2. **PRIORITY 2**: Un-select functionality - allow deselection at all nested levels
3. **PRIORITY 3**: Field swapping system - three modes (miscellaneous notes, site metadata, human input)

** Key Resources
- apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py - Core UI and JavaScript system
- apps/content_extractor/selectors/selection_context.py - Nested context management  
- apps/content_extractor/management/commands/test_nested_selector.py - Testing suite
- .project_management/next_steps/stellar-phoenix_next_steps.org - Detailed requirements

* Turn 1: Handoff Reception and Architecture Review
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Initial
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- Received handoff from Stellar Phoenix confirming production-ready nested selection system
- Reviewed detailed requirements in next steps document
- Architecture confirmed validated through user testing
- Three clear priorities established with specific requirements

** Analysis Completed
- Reviewed interactive_selector.py structure (3300 lines) - found JavaScript injection system
- Examined selection_context.py (334 lines) - understood nested context management
- Confirmed testing infrastructure available and functional
- Identified approach strategy for implementing draggable functionality

** Next Steps Identified
Beginning implementation of Priority 1: Draggable menu system
- Target: Field selection menu, instruction boxes, control panels
- Approach: Add drag event handlers to JavaScript injection
- Requirements: Default starting positions, no persistence between sessions

* Turn 2: Priority 1 Implementation - Draggable Menu System
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Current
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- User reported field menu not appearing during testing
- Identified JavaScript error preventing menu display
- Root cause: SVG data URL with unencoded angle brackets in makeDraggable function
- Fixed encoding issue and restored functionality

** Changes Made
- Added comprehensive draggable functionality to JavaScript injection system:
  - Global dragging state management
  - makeDraggable() function with visual feedback and drag handles
  - Mouse event handlers for drag start, move, and end
  - Viewport boundary constraints for dragged elements
  - Visual feedback during dragging (opacity, scale, shadow)
- Applied draggable functionality to:
  - Field selection menu (#field-selection-menu)
  - Floating control panel (#field-menu-toggle)
- Fixed SVG data URL encoding in drag indicator to prevent JavaScript parsing errors

** Technical Implementation Details
- Dragging state tracked in window.contentExtractorData.dragging object
- Visual drag indicator (dots pattern) added to draggable elements
- Prevents text selection and unwanted interactions during drag
- Maintains original styling and z-index after drag completion
- Constrains movement within viewport boundaries

** Testing Status
- Fixed JavaScript syntax error that prevented menu display
- Ready for user testing of draggable functionality
- Field menu should now appear with drag capabilities

** Next Steps Identified
1. Confirm draggable field menu working in browser test
2. Implement Priority 2: Un-select functionality for all nested levels
3. Implement Priority 3: Field swapping system with three modes

* Turn 3: Critical Issue Discovery and Cleanup Preparation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Final
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- User tested draggable implementation but field menu still not appearing
- Chrome driver errors indicate webdriver session management issues
- Browser window closing prematurely ("target window already closed")
- Critical blocker preventing validation of all implemented draggable functionality

** Issue Analysis
- Root cause likely: Webdriver session management, browser lifecycle, or Chrome driver compatibility
- JavaScript syntax errors were resolved but underlying display issue persists
- Implementation complete but cannot be tested due to browser/webdriver problems
- Error pattern suggests browser window closing before JavaScript injection completes

** Cleanup Actions Completed
- Created comprehensive cleanup report documenting all work and ongoing critical issue
- Prepared detailed next steps with investigation priorities for following model
- Updated model tracking with current status and handoff context
- Documented complete draggable implementation for future validation

** Critical Handoff Requirements
1. **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Resolve field menu display issue through webdriver debugging
2. **SECONDARY**: Validate completed draggable functionality once display issue fixed
3. **TERTIARY**: Continue with Priority 2 and 3 implementations

** Session Outcome
- ‚úÖ Priority 1 draggable system: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- ‚ùå Priority 1 validation: BLOCKED by critical display issue  
- ‚ùå Priority 2 & 3: NOT STARTED due to blocker
- üîÑ REQUIRES IMMEDIATE CONTINUATION by next model to resolve webdriver issues
