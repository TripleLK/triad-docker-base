* Turn 1: System Handoff and Direction Change Analysis
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 14:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- Received handoff from Crimson Viper regarding completed multi-element subfield management system
- User requested major direction change away from LabEquipmentPage direct population
- New focus on AI preparation system with three core requirements:
  1. XPath Editor Modal System with generalization and click-to-preview
  2. AI Preparation Data Model with long string fields
  3. Comment Field Integration for AI context

** Changes Made
- Updated `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org`:
  - Added new section "CRITICAL: MAJOR DIRECTION CHANGE - AI PREPARATION FOCUSED SYSTEM"
  - Documented three new system requirements with detailed specifications
  - Moved previous implementation plans to "DEPRIORITIZED/ARCHIVED WORK" section
  - Updated current priorities and architectural implications

- Created `.project_management/next_steps/thunder_hawk_direction_analysis.org`:
  - Comprehensive 200+ line technical analysis document
  - Detailed requirements for XPath Editor Modal System
  - Proposed AIPreparationRecord model structure with full field specifications
  - Comment field integration analysis and implementation approach
  - Risk assessment and migration strategy
  - Resource requirements and development effort estimates

** Rationale
The user provided clear guidance that the system needs to shift from direct model population to AI preparation focus. This fundamental change requires:
- Interactive xpath editing capabilities for user control
- String-based data storage optimized for AI consumption
- Rich comment system for AI context enhancement

The comprehensive analysis document provides a roadmap for implementing these requirements while maintaining existing functionality.

** Next Steps Identified
1. Implement AIPreparationRecord model as foundation
2. Create basic XPath editor modal interface
3. Add comment input capabilities to existing menu system
4. Begin migration from LabEquipmentPage targeting
