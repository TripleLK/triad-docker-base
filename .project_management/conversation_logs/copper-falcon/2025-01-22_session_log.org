* Turn 1: Handoff Analysis and URL Fix
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:50:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - Took over from Thunder Phoenix who identified AIPreparationRecord admin issues
   - Thunder Phoenix fixed ModelAdmin integration but found runtime template/URL errors
   - User clarified need to view saved content extractors, not just Upload Data menu

** Changes Made
   - Updated .project_management/model_name_tracking.org with Copper Falcon entry
   - Fixed missing URL pattern issue in upload_config.html template
   - Removed "Get Bookmarklet" button that referenced non-existent 'content_extractor_bookmarklet' URL

** Rationale
   Thunder Phoenix identified the Upload Data menu was producing 500 errors due to missing URL pattern. By removing the problematic button reference, eliminated the NoReverseMatch error blocking template rendering.

** Next Steps Identified
   Test admin interface access to verify AI Preparation Records are visible

* Turn 2: Critical Model Purpose Discovery
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 17:00:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   User provided critical clarification about model requirements:
   - Current AIPreparationRecord model is completely wrong approach
   - Don't need page-level granular extraction tracking
   - Need site-level configuration for Lab Equipment Page model field processing
   - XPath selectors should be stored per field per site, not per extraction session

** Changes Made
   - Created comprehensive redesign plan in copper-falcon_next_steps.org
   - Documented correct model structure: SiteConfiguration + FieldConfiguration
   - Outlined proper workflow: site config → XPath extraction → AI processing → LabEquipmentPage JSON

** Rationale
   The entire approach has been based on wrong understanding of requirements. Instead of tracking individual extractions, need to configure XPath selectors that can be reused across pages from the same site to populate LabEquipmentPage model fields.

** Next Steps Identified
   Complete model redesign required - delete current model and create site-level configuration system

* Turn 3: Cleanup Documentation and Handoff Preparation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 17:10:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   User requested planning documentation and cleanup for new model handoff rather than implementation. Created comprehensive planning documents and cleanup reports.

** Changes Made
   - Created detailed copper-falcon_cleanup.org with discovery summary
   - Documented technical specifications for SiteConfiguration and FieldConfiguration models
   - Outlined 3-phase implementation plan with time estimates
   - Prepared handoff documentation for next model

** Rationale
   User specifically requested planning rather than implementation. Better to hand off with clear requirements and technical specifications than attempt partial implementation of major architectural change.

** Cross-References
   - Next Steps: .project_management/next_steps/copper-falcon_next_steps.org
   - Cleanup Report: .project_management/cleanup_reports/copper-falcon_cleanup.org
   - Model Tracking: .project_management/model_name_tracking.org

* Session Summary
  Successfully fixed immediate template/URL blocking issues but discovered fundamental architectural mismatch. Current AIPreparationRecord model designed for page-level extraction tracking when user actually needs site-level field configuration system. Created comprehensive redesign plan for next model implementation.

** Key Discoveries
   - Template/URL errors were surface-level symptoms of deeper model design issues
   - User needs site-configuration approach, not extraction tracking approach
   - XPath selectors should be reusable configuration, not individual extraction records
   - LabEquipmentPage model integration is core requirement, not data validation metrics

** Handoff Status
   Ready for complete model redesign with detailed technical specifications and implementation roadmap prepared.
