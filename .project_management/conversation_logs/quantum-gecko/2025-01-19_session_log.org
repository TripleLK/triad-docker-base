* Turn 2: API Revamp Analysis and Comprehensive Plan Creation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 19:15:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User requested comprehensive API revamp with focus on flexibility and ease of use
   - Need to extract API to own app and enable single-call setup of tags/specs/models
   - User specified to maintain current system while building new version alongside
   - Request to create plan that replaces current active work tracking document

** Changes Made
   - **CREATED**: Comprehensive API revamp plan replacing `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org`
   - **ANALYZED**: Current API structure across multiple apps (base_site, ai_processing, categorized_tags)
   - **DESIGNED**: New `lab_equipment_api` app architecture with modern REST framework
   - **PLANNED**: Four-phase implementation strategy with detailed objectives and success criteria

** Analysis Conducted
   *** Current API Assessment
       - Examined `apps/base_site/api.py` (763 lines) - single equipment focus, complex tag processing
       - Reviewed `apps/ai_processing/` - batch URL processing, validation systems
       - Analyzed `apps/categorized_tags/` - tag management and categorization system
       - Identified authentication system in `apps/base_site/auth.py` with token-based security
       - Mapped current models: LabEquipmentPage, CategorizedTag, Spec, EquipmentModel, etc.

   *** Key Limitations Identified
       - No batch operations for equipment creation
       - Complex tag processing with legacy format support
       - Limited specification group management
       - Basic model handling without advanced features
       - Scattered authentication across endpoints
       - No API versioning strategy

** New Architecture Design
   *** Core Design Principles
       1. Batch-first operations for all endpoints
       2. Single-call complete equipment configuration
       3. Comprehensive validation with detailed error reporting
       4. Smart conflict resolution for duplicates
       5. Migration-friendly transition from v1 to v2

   *** API Structure
       - v2 endpoints: /api/v2/equipment/, /tags/, /specifications/, /models/, /images/, /system/
       - Legacy compatibility: v1 endpoints maintained during transition
       - Modern DRF architecture with serializers, viewsets, permissions
       - Comprehensive testing and documentation framework

** Implementation Strategy
   *** Phase 1: Foundation (App creation, auth, core models)
   *** Phase 2: Batch Operations (Equipment, tags, specs, models with single-call setup)
   *** Phase 3: Advanced Features (Validation, conflict resolution, search)
   *** Phase 4: Documentation and Migration (Testing, docs, v1->v2 migration)

** Technical Specifications
   - Dependencies: DRF, Celery, Redis, Pillow, BeautifulSoup4
   - Performance requirements: <500ms single calls, <5s batch operations
   - Security: Input validation, rate limiting, audit logging
   - Success metrics: Technical, UX, and business impact measurements

** Rationale
   - Current API system fragmented across multiple apps limits flexibility
   - Single equipment focus requires multiple API calls for complex setups
   - New unified API will enable efficient batch operations and single-call configuration
   - Parallel development approach ensures no disruption to existing workflows
   - Comprehensive plan provides clear roadmap for enhanced lab equipment management

** Current State Assessment
   - Project structure is stable and ready for new development work
   - Existing API system identified and mapped comprehensively
   - Clear path forward with detailed implementation phases
   - All major limitations and improvement opportunities documented
   - Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation when approved

** Next Steps Identified
   - Begin Phase 1.1: Create new `lab_equipment_api` Django app
   - Set up Django REST Framework integration
   - Design core models for API operations tracking
   - Implement new authentication and permissions system
   - Create base infrastructure for API operations
