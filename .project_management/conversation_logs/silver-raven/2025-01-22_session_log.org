* Turn 1: Model Redesign Implementation - Site Configuration System
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [current time]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - Took over from Copper Falcon who identified fundamental model design mismatch
   - User confirmed need for site-level configuration approach vs page-level tracking
   - Implemented complete model restructure using Wagtail snippets (per user suggestion)
   - Replaced complex ModelAdmin with simple snippet registration

** Changes Made
   - apps/content_extractor/models.py - Complete replacement with SiteConfiguration and FieldConfiguration models
   - apps/content_extractor/wagtail_hooks.py - Replaced ModelAdmin with snippet registration
   - apps/content_extractor/admin.py - Cleaned up old model references
   - apps/content_extractor/forms.py - DELETED (no longer needed)
   - apps/content_extractor/templates/wagtailadmin/content_extractor/upload_config.html - DELETED
   - apps/content_extractor/templates/wagtailadmin/content_extractor/field_wizard.html - DELETED
   - Database migration: 0006_create_site_configuration_models.py - Applied successfully

** Rationale
   User correctly identified that snippets are much simpler than ModelAdmin for this use case. 
   The new approach provides:
   - Site-level configuration instead of per-extraction tracking
   - XPath selectors stored per LabEquipmentPage field per site domain
   - Inline editing of field configurations within site configurations
   - Standard Wagtail admin interface (much cleaner)
   - JSON field for XPath selector arrays with fallback support

** Next Steps Identified
   Test the new snippet interface in Wagtail admin and verify field configuration workflow

** Architecture Impact
   - Completely replaced page-level extraction tracking model
   - Aligned with actual user workflow: configure once per site â†’ extract any page
   - Supports AI-assisted content extraction with proper field mapping
   - Integration ready for LabEquipmentPage model field processing

** Cross-References
   - Handoff from: .project_management/cleanup_reports/copper-falcon_cleanup.org
   - Next steps: .project_management/next_steps/silver-raven_next_steps.org

* Turn 2: Critical Error Discovery and Cleanup Preparation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [current time]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User tested snippet interface and discovered InlinePanel KeyError
   - Error blocking access to Site Configuration snippet add page
   - User requested cleanup and handoff to next model for error fix
   - Identified need for interactive selector integration as next major task

** Critical Issue Identified
   - KeyError: 'field_configs' in snippet admin interface
   - Root cause: Proxy model setup not handling InlinePanel formsets properly
   - Blocks all admin functionality for site configuration management

** Cleanup Documentation Created
   - .project_management/cleanup_reports/silver-raven_cleanup.org - Complete status and error analysis
   - .project_management/next_steps/silver-raven_next_steps.org - Detailed fix instructions and integration plan

** Handoff Preparation
   - Documented 95% completion status (models working, admin interface blocked)
   - Provided detailed error analysis and solution options
   - Outlined complete integration plan for interactive selector connection
   - Prepared technical specifications for next model implementation

** Session Status
   Major architectural success with critical admin interface blocker requiring immediate fix.
   Next model has clear roadmap for completion and integration.
