* Turn 1: Add Specification Group Names Field
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested adding a new specification group names field to the content extractor to:
- Extract actual specification group names from source data
- Direct AI models to use ALL specification groups where possible
- Eliminate underscores and special characters from group/spec names
- Ensure consistency across model batches

** Changes Made
1. **apps/content_extractor/models.py** (line ~78): Added 'specification_group_names' to LAB_EQUIPMENT_FIELD_CHOICES
2. **apps/content_extractor/selectors/selection_context.py** (line ~52): Added specification_group_names field to interactive selector
3. **Migration**: Created and applied 0010_add_specification_group_names migration
4. **apps/content_extractor/management/commands/export_ai_json.py**:
   - Added extract_specification_group_names_from_record() method (lines ~205-235)
   - Updated two-mode export to extract and include spec group names (line ~100)
   - Added specification instructions to model subset data (lines ~185-195)
5. **.project_management/ai_prompts/ai_json_to_lab_equipment_api.md**:
   - Added "SPECIFICATION GROUP EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS" section
   - Added naming standards prohibiting underscores
   - Updated validation checklist for group name compliance
   - Added specification instructions handling

** Rationale
Direct extraction of specification group names from source content ensures:
- Perfect consistency across model batches
- Complete utilization of all available specification groups
- Elimination of AI model confusion about group naming
- Prevention of incomplete extractions that skip technical groups

** Next Steps Identified
- Test with content extractor to extract specification group names
- Verify AI models use extracted group names exactly as provided
- Confirm no underscores appear in generated specifications
- Validate complete specification group coverage vs source data

* Turn 2: Fix Field Selector Error
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:45:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User reported "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" error in field_selector command. Investigation revealed the issue was in `get_all_field_selections()` method attempting to iterate over hierarchical data structure incorrectly.

** Problem Analysis
The `nested_manager.export_all_selections()` returns a nested hierarchy structure from `export_hierarchy()`, but the code was trying to iterate as if it was a flat dictionary with `exported_data.items()`. This caused the method to try calling `.get()` on string values instead of dictionaries.

** Changes Made
1. **apps/content_extractor/management/commands/field_selector.py**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling and type checking in `_wait_for_selections()` method
   - Added defensive programming for unexpected data types
2. **apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py**:
   - Fixed `get_all_field_selections()` method to properly handle hierarchical structure
   - Added recursive function `extract_selections_from_hierarchy()` to traverse nested data
   - Added try/catch for nested manager failures with fallback to legacy methods
   - Enhanced selection extraction from multiple sources (nested, session data, selected_elements)

** Testing Results
Field selector command now runs successfully without errors:
- ✅ Page loads correctly
- ✅ Field menu displays properly  
- ✅ No "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" error
- ✅ Proper timeout handling
- ✅ Clean exit and browser cleanup

** Rationale
The hierarchical selection structure returned by the nested manager requires recursive traversal to extract individual selections. The fix ensures compatibility between the nested selection system and the flat field selection interface expected by the command. 

* Turn 3: Combined Command Creation and Enhancements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 17:10:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested a combined command that performs both generate_ai_json and export_ai_json operations in one step, focusing only on the most recent version of JSON data. Additionally, user pointed out two important requirements:
1. spec_group_names need to be included in batch model JSON files
2. All matches should be shown, not just the first 5

** Problem Analysis
1. **Match Limitation**: Found hard-coded limit in generate_ai_json.py line 203: `for element in elements[:5]` was restricting to first 5 matches
2. **Spec Group Coverage**: While spec_group_names were being extracted, they needed the `available_groups` field added to specification instructions for complete coverage

** Changes Made
1. **apps/content_extractor/management/commands/generate_ai_json.py**:
   - Removed arbitrary limit of 5 matches per selector (line 203)
   - Changed `for element in elements[:5]` to `for element in elements` to show ALL matches

2. **apps/content_extractor/management/commands/process_and_export_ai_json.py** (NEW FILE):
   - Created combined command that does both generation and export in one step
   - Focuses only on most recent JSON versions (is_current=True filter)
   - Enhanced spec_group_names support with `available_groups` field
   - Includes comprehensive status reporting during processing
   - Uses two-mode processing (Overall Details + Model Subsets)
   - Full argument support for domain, url-id, all-sites, output-dir, models-per-batch, etc.

3. **apps/content_extractor/management/commands/export_ai_json.py**:
   - Added `available_groups` field to specification instructions
   - Ensures consistency between combined command and standalone export command

** Testing Results
- Combined command recognized by Django management system
- Help text displays correctly with all argument options
- Command integrates existing GenerateCommand and ExportCommand functionality
- Ensures spec_group_names are included in model subset data with enhanced metadata

** Rationale
The combined command eliminates the need to run two separate commands while ensuring:
- Only most recent data is exported (no historical bloat)
- All selector matches are captured (removes arbitrary 5-match limit)
- Complete specification group coverage with available_groups metadata
- Streamlined workflow for AI JSON pipeline
- Consistent two-mode processing for model subset handling 

* Turn 4: Combined Command Execution and Fix Verification
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 17:18:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested execution of the combined command for airscience domain. During testing, discovered that the "show all matches" fix wasn't taking effect because existing AI JSON records were cached. Used --force-refresh flag to regenerate data with updated code.

** Changes Made
- Executed combined command: `python manage.py process_and_export_ai_json --domain www.airscience.com --force-refresh`
- Verified that all matches are now shown instead of first 5 limit
- Confirmed specification group names are properly included in all export files

** Rationale
Force refresh was necessary to regenerate AI JSON records with the updated extraction logic that removes the 5-match limit. This ensures all extracted data is available for AI processing rather than truncated subsets.

** Test Results
- SafeFUME product now shows 8 specification groups (increased from 5): "Dimensions & Weights, Construction, Protection & Compliance, Options And Accessories, Airflow & Filtration, Warranty, Electrical, Controls & Monitoring"
- Model batches increased from 2 to 3 for SafeFUME, indicating more complete extraction
- All files now show "All matches shown" instead of "Showing first 5 of 72 matches"
- Specification group names properly included in model subset files with available_groups metadata

** Verification Commands
```bash
python manage.py process_and_export_ai_json --domain www.airscience.com --force-refresh
grep "preview_note" ai_json_exports/two_mode/SafeFUME_*_overall_details_*.json
```

** Next Steps Identified
- Test combined command with other domains to ensure consistent behavior
- Monitor performance with larger datasets now that all matches are processed 

* Turn 5: Specification Groups in Overall Details Enhancement
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 17:25:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested that specification group names be included in overall details files (not just model subset files), ensuring unique names only. Also confirmed that case correction should be automatic from source data, not hardcoded. User rejected the export_ai_json changes but accepted the combined command updates.

** Problem Analysis
Specification groups were only being added to model subset files but not overall details files. This limited the AI model's ability to see the complete specification structure when processing overall details. The deduplication and case correction were already working properly but needed to be applied to both file types.

** Changes Made
1. **apps/content_extractor/management/commands/process_and_export_ai_json.py**:
   - Added spec group extraction to overall details files (lines 203-211)
   - Added status reporting showing number of specification groups included
   - Ensured extracted_specification_groups and _specification_instructions appear in both overall details and model subset files

** Verification of Automatic Processing
- Case correction happens automatically via title case conversion in extract_specification_group_names_from_record()
- Deduplication already implemented in same method (lines 261-265 in export_ai_json.py)
- No hardcoding - all processing based on actual extracted content from source data
- Title case formatting: `' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in clean_name.split())`

** User Instructions for Next Model
User requested cleanup and indicated next model will work on:
- Creating management command to combine multiple AI JSON result files
- Input the combined results as new Lab Equipment Pages
- Support for both overall details and model subset file formats
- Command should accept directory path containing the files to process

** Next Steps Identified
- Archive temporary files and create cleanup documentation
- Next model should focus on AI JSON file combination and Lab Equipment Page creation
- Key files to review: process_and_export_ai_json.py, export_ai_json.py for understanding file structure
- Consider file naming patterns for automatic detection and combination logic
