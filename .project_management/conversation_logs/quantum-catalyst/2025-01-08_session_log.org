- Supports both single-value and multi-value field types appropriately
- Creates foundation for next phase (multi-value generalization)
- Enables testing and validation of field selection workflow

** Next Steps Identified
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Test field selection functionality on various sites
2. **PRIORITY 1**: Implement multi-value field generalization algorithm
3. **PRIORITY 2**: Enhance database storage for field-specific selections
4. **PRIORITY 3**: Create field-specific export and management tools

* Turn 3: Enhanced UI Styling and Menu Persistence - COMPLETE
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 09:45:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- Fixed critical UX issue: field menu disappearing after field selection
- Enhanced visual styling with better contrast and hover effects
- Added field completion status indicators throughout the interface
- Implemented floating toggle button for easy field switching
- Improved element selection visibility with enhanced highlighting

** Changes Made
- **ENHANCED** `apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py`:
  - Improved element highlighting with stronger outlines, shadows, and z-index positioning
  - Added visual selection badges (checkmarks) to selected elements
  - Enhanced field selection menu with gradient backgrounds and improved contrast
  - Added field completion status indicators (âœ… for completed, â­• for incomplete, ðŸŽ¯ for ready-to-generalize)
  - Implemented progress tracking display in field menu
  - Created floating "Switch Field" toggle button that persists during selection
  - Added current field indicator to floating toggle
  - Enhanced instruction panel with better styling and clearer information
  - Added "Clear All" functionality with confirmation dialog

* Turn 4: CSS Interference Issues Identified - Documentation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 10:15:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- Successfully fixed UI element protection and event handling
- Identified critical CSS interference issues affecting UI styling
- UI elements are now properly protected from selection but styling remains problematic
- Site CSS overriding content extractor UI styles causing visibility issues

** Issues Discovered During Testing
- **CSS Inheritance Problem**: Site CSS affecting content extractor UI elements
- **Text Color Issues**: White text on elements making them unreadable
- **Element Sizing Issues**: Site CSS causing wrong dimensions for UI components
- **Specificity Problems**: Content extractor styles not overriding site styles effectively

** Solutions Implemented This Session
âœ… **UI Element Protection**: Added `data-content-extractor-ui` attributes and filtering
âœ… **Event Handling**: Proper event stopping to prevent interference with UI elements
âœ… **Selection Badge Protection**: Checkmarks can no longer be selected as content
âœ… **Floating Toggle Button**: Persistent field switching capability maintained

** Remaining Technical Debt for Next Model
1. **CRITICAL**: CSS isolation - Use `!important` declarations for all UI styles
2. **CRITICAL**: Higher CSS specificity - Use more specific selectors to override site styles  
3. **ENHANCEMENT**: Consider CSS-in-JS with forced styling or shadow DOM isolation
4. **TESTING**: Validate UI visibility across different site designs and CSS frameworks

** Next Steps Identified for Handoff
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix CSS interference with `!important` declarations and higher specificity
2. **PRIORITY 1**: Test fixed styling on provided airscience.com URLs
3. **PRIORITY 2**: Implement multi-value field generalization algorithm
4. **PRIORITY 3**: Enhance database storage for field-specific selections
5. **PRIORITY 4**: Create field-specific export and management tools
