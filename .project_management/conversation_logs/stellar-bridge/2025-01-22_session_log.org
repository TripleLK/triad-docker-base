* Turn 1: AI JSON Import System Implementation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 14:00:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- Inherited Dynamic Flux work on AI JSON processing
- Goal: Create management command to import AI JSON files into Lab Equipment Pages
- Input: AI-generated JSON files (overall_details + model batches)
- Output: Complete Lab Equipment Pages with all nested data

** Changes Made
*** Created `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/import_ai_json_to_equipment.py`
- Lines 1-200+: Complete management command for AI JSON import
- Auto-detects file types by JSON content analysis
- Combines overall details with model batch files
- Uses existing LabEquipmentPageCreateUpdateSerializer

*** Modified `apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py`
- Lines 250-330: Enhanced create() method with nested data processing
- Lines 330-380: Fixed create_models() method 
- Lines 380-400: Enhanced create_specification_groups() method
- Lines 400-420: Enhanced create_features() method
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout

*** Updated `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org`
- Added "Stellar Bridge" code name entry

** Issues Identified But Not Yet Resolved
*** CRITICAL: Models Not Being Created
- LabEquipmentPage creates successfully with basic data
- SEO content, categorized tags working correctly
- But EquipmentModel objects count = 0 (should be 9)
- Specification groups, features also not creating properly

*** Debugging Steps Taken
- Added extensive logging to serializer methods
- Confirmed JSON data structure is correct
- Verified create_models() method logic
- Problem: Debug logging not appearing despite code changes

** Data Flow Confirmed
1. `ai_json_exports/` → AI processing → `analysis_outputs/page_jsons/SafeFUME/Claude 3.7 Sonnet/`
2. Import command combines: overall_details.json + models_batch_*.json
3. Creates LabEquipmentPage via API serializer
4. PROBLEM: Nested models/specs/features creation failing silently

** Testing Results
- Page creation: ✅ Working
- SEO content: ✅ Working (853 characters)
- Categorized tags: ✅ Working (5 tags)
- Specification groups: ❌ Count = 0 (should be 3)
- Models: ❌ Count = 0 (should be 9) 
- Features: ❌ Count = 0 (should be 7)

** Next Steps Identified
1. **URGENT**: Debug why create_models() method not executing
2. **URGENT**: Fix silent failures in nested object creation
3. Test with logging enabled properly
4. Verify models creation is working before testing images
5. Add image import functionality once models are working
