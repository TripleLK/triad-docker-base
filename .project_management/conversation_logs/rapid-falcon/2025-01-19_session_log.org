* Turn 1: File Inventory Assessment and Reorganization Planning
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Start of session]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User requested continuation of Silver Mongoose's work on file structure reorganization
   - Rapid Falcon conducted comprehensive file inventory of project
   - Analyzed current Django app structure and identified cleanup opportunities
   - Proposed new directory structure aligned with Django best practices
   - User provided clarifications on vendor-specific vs functionality-specific apps
   - User confirmed project status (non-live version, can be aggressive with changes)

** Changes Made
   - Updated .project_management/model_name_tracking.org - Added Rapid Falcon entry
   - Created .project_management/conversation_logs/rapid-falcon/ directory
   - Created this conversation log file

** Key Decisions from User Input
   1. **Analysis Files**: Archive all comparison output directories (6+ timestamped dirs)
   2. **Vendor Strategy**: No vendor-specific apps - create functionality-specific apps that work with all vendors
      - Triad is the client company, vendor testing was just for system validation
      - Equipment vendors (airscience, hplc asi, adam equipment) were test cases
   3. **Production Status**: Working on non-live version, can be aggressive with restructuring

** File Inventory Findings
   - **Root Level Clutter**: Large JSON test files (782KB-866KB), multiple comparison directories, scattered scripts
   - **Django Apps**: Well-organized functionally (scrapers, search, categorized_tags, ai_processing, base_site)
   - **Cleanup Candidates**: Temporary analysis outputs, log files, scattered test files
   - **Proposed Structure**: Consolidated scripts/, tests/, new docs/, data/, analysis_outputs/, logs/ directories

** Rationale
   - Django app structure is solid and follows functionality-based organization correctly
   - Root directory cleanup will improve maintainability and follow Django best practices
   - Archival structure will preserve analysis history while decluttering active workspace
   - New organization supports multi-vendor compatibility as requested

** Next Steps Identified
   - Create new reorganized directory structure
   - Begin archiving temporary analysis files
   - Consolidate scattered files into proper directories
   - Eventually replace current structure with new organization

** Cross-References
   - Related to Silver Mongoose cleanup: .project_management/cleanup_reports/silver-mongoose_cleanup.org
   - Next steps from previous session: .project_management/next_steps/silver-mongoose_next_steps.org
   - Active work tracking: .project_management/active_work_tracking.org

* Turn 2: Creating Reorganized Directory Structure
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Mid-session]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User clarified to work within project directory (not external)
   - User emphasized making incremental changes with testing between major steps
   - Successfully created triad-reorganized/ directory within current project
   - Built basic Django structure and tested functionality

** Changes Made
   - Created triad-reorganized/ directory in project root
   - Copied core Django files: manage.py, requirements.txt, README.md, wsgi.py, .gitignore
   - Copied config/ directory with Django settings
   - Copied all apps/ from original structure
   - Copied static/ files and db.sqlite3.example
   - Created logs/ directory with .gitkeep

** Testing Results
   - Django project structure validation: ✅ PASSED
   - python manage.py check --deploy: ✅ PASSED (6 security warnings expected for dev)
   - Development server startup: ✅ PASSED (successfully started on port 8001)
   - All Django apps recognized and loading properly

** Rationale
   - Incremental approach allows testing at each stage
   - Core Django functionality working before moving scattered files
   - Preserves original structure while building improved version

* Turn 3: Django Settings Investigation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Current]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User applied database migrations successfully
   - Attempted to run create_admin.py script but encountered settings error
   - Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'apps.base_site.settings'"
   - Need to investigate Django settings configuration in reorganized structure

** Issue Identified
   - create_admin.py script failing to import apps.base_site.settings
   - Django structure appears correct (apps/, base_site/, __init__.py files present)
   - Possible settings module configuration issue or missing file

** Changes Made
   - Updated conversation log with recent session turns

** Next Steps Identified
   - Investigate create_admin.py script to understand what it's trying to import
   - Check Django settings configuration for base_site app
   - Verify apps.base_site.settings module exists and is properly configured
   - Fix settings import issue to enable admin panel testing

* Turn 4: Django Settings Investigation (INTERRUPTED)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Previous turn - cut off prematurely]
  :STATUS: INCOMPLETE - Model was cut off mid-investigation
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - Investigated create_admin.py script settings import issue
   - Identified that script was trying to import "apps.base_site.settings.dev"
   - Discovered correct settings path should be "config.settings.dev"
   - Attempted to fix the import path but issue persisted
   - Model was cut off before completing the diagnosis

** Changes Made
   - Modified create_admin.py:6 - Changed DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE from "apps.base_site.settings.dev" to "config.settings.dev"
   - Updated conversation logging rules in .cursor/rules/02_conversation_logging.mdc - Added premature cutoff recovery protocol

** Incomplete Investigation
   - Fixed create_admin.py settings path but error persisted
   - Error still showed "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'apps.base_site.settings'"
   - Suggests the error may be coming from Django configuration files, not just the script
   - Need to check environment variables and Django configuration

** Rationale
   - The create_admin script was using outdated settings path from previous project structure
   - Correcting the path should resolve the import issue
   - Persistent error indicates deeper configuration issue requiring further investigation

** Work Left Incomplete
   - Check DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable
   - Investigate manage.py and other Django configuration files
   - Verify all references to old settings paths are updated
   - Test admin panel access once settings issue is resolved

** Resolution Note (Added by Swift Penguin)
   - Issue was resolved in subsequent session by correcting create_admin.py settings path
   - Admin creation script now works successfully with config.settings.dev path
