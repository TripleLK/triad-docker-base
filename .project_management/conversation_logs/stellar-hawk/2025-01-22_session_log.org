* Turn 1: XPath Highlighting Issue Resolution
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [HH:MM:SS]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User reported that the AirScience XPath `//[@id="tab[X]"]` only selects tab[1] instead of all matching tabs. Investigation revealed two issues:

1. **Malformed XPath Pattern**: The pattern `tab[X]` is invalid XPath syntax
2. **Missing Global Function**: `highlightElement()` function was missing from main events file

** Changes Made
*** Created Django Management Command
- File: `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/fix_xpath_patterns.py`
- Purpose: Fix malformed XPath patterns in FieldConfiguration model
- Converts `//[@id="tab[X]"]` to `//div[starts-with(@id, "tab")]`
- Lines: 1-104 (complete file)

*** Added Missing highlightElement Function
- File: `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_events.js`
- Added function to handle element highlighting with outline and box-shadow
- Lines: 143-149 (new function insertion)

*** Enhanced Debug Logging
- File: `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_events.js`
- Added detailed logging to `applyExistingSelectors()` function
- Lines: 67-138 (enhanced existing function)

** Rationale
The XPath editor highlighting worked correctly because it had its own `highlightElement()` method, but the automatic highlighting (`applyExistingSelectors()`) was calling a non-existent global function, causing silent failures.

** Testing Verification
- Management command confirmed XPath patterns were already corrected
- XPath editor highlighting works for all 4 tabs
- Next test: Automatic highlighting should now work for all matching elements

** Next Steps Identified
- User to test automatic highlighting with refreshed page
- Verify all 4 tabs are highlighted when not in XPath editor mode
- Monitor console logs for debugging information
