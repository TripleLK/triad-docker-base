* Turn 1: Cursor Rules Streamlining
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 14:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User requested takeover from Ancient Storm to overhaul cursor rules
   - Goal: Minimize rules to include only actual rules and processes
   - Remove rationales and explanations that hinder model performance
   - Cut back as much as possible while maintaining essential rules

** Changes Made
   - Modified .cursor/rules/01_basic_protocols.mdc:1-103 - Streamlined from 103 to 25 lines, removed verbose explanations
   - Modified .cursor/rules/02_conversation_logging.mdc:1-119 - Streamlined from 119 to 45 lines, kept essential logging requirements
   - Modified .cursor/rules/03_cleanup_protocol.mdc:1-151 - Streamlined from 151 to 60 lines, condensed cleanup steps
   - Modified .cursor/rules/00_rules_index.mdc:1-53 - Streamlined from 53 to 25 lines, removed lengthy rationales
   - Modified .cursor/rules/04_naming_conventions.mdc:1-64 - Streamlined from 64 to 35 lines, kept essential standards
   - Modified .cursor/rules/05_change_management.mdc:1-43 - Streamlined from 43 to 25 lines, maintained approval categories
   - Modified .cursor/rules/06_django_specific.mdc:1-53 - Streamlined from 53 to 20 lines, kept essential Django guidelines
   - Modified .cursor/rules/07_web_testing_protocols.mdc:1-61 - Streamlined from 61 to 30 lines, maintained testing requirements
   - Modified .cursor/rules/08_rule_maintenance.mdc:1-77 - Streamlined from 77 to 40 lines, kept maintenance workflow
   - Modified .cursor/rules/09_project_layout_compliance.mdc:1-108 - Streamlined from 108 to 50 lines, maintained validation requirements

** Rationale
   - Removed verbose explanations, rationales, and examples that were making rules too long
   - Maintained all essential requirements and critical protocols
   - Kept CRITICAL markers for most important rules
   - Preserved functional organization while dramatically reducing cognitive load
   - Maintained rule structure and cross-references
   - Reduced total rule content by approximately 60% while preserving functionality

** Cross-References
   - All rule files in .cursor/rules/ directory updated
   - Rule tracking system maintained
   - No changes to rule_application_tracking.org (preserved existing classification)

** Next Steps Identified
   - Rules are now significantly more concise and focused
   - Should improve model performance by reducing cognitive overhead
   - May need user feedback on whether further streamlining is needed
   - All essential protocols and requirements preserved
