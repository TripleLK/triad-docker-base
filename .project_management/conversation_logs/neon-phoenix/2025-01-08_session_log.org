* Turn 1: Session Handoff and Problem Analysis
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Session Start
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Received handoff from Electric Sentinel with clear context about completed JavaScript modularization and 3 priority UI issues needing resolution. User provided detailed summary of current system status and specific problems requiring fixes.

** Priority Issues Identified:
1. **UI Element Selection Protection**: Hover outlines showing on UI elements during selection mode
2. **Page Interaction During Selection**: Users stuck in selection mode with no normal page interaction
3. **Selection Menu Persistence**: Menu auto-closing after single selection, problematic for single-value fields

** Rationale
Electric Sentinel had completed the technical foundation with proper JavaScript modularization. The focus needed to shift from technical architecture to user experience improvements.

** Next Steps Identified
- Fix all 3 priority issues with comprehensive solutions
- Enhance user control over selection workflow
- Implement extensible architecture for future input methods

* Turn 2: UI Element Selection Protection Implementation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Implementation Phase 1
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Tackled Priority 1 by implementing comprehensive UI element filtering in event handlers to prevent hover outlines and selection conflicts.

** Changes Made
- Modified handleMouseOver function (content_extractor_events.js)
- Modified handleMouseOut function (content_extractor_events.js) 
- Enhanced handleElementClick with UI element filtering
- Added content-extractor-ui class marking system for all injected elements

** Rationale
Used consistent filtering pattern across all event handlers to identify and ignore injected UI elements by both ID and CSS class. This ensures seamless user experience without hover effects on UI components.

** Cross-References
- Technical implementation details in cleanup report
- UI element identification patterns documented

* Turn 3: Pause/Resume Functionality Implementation  
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Implementation Phase 2
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Addressed Priority 2 by implementing pause/resume functionality rather than stopping selection entirely, preserving user context while allowing normal page interaction.

** Changes Made
- Added isSelectionPaused state to contentExtractorData
- Created toggleSelectionMode function with visual feedback
- Enhanced selection indicator with Pause/Resume buttons
- Modified event handlers to respect paused state
- Implemented clear visual status indicators (ACTIVE/PAUSED)

** Rationale
Pause/resume pattern maintains user's selection context while providing normal page interaction capability. Visual feedback with color changes and status text keeps users informed of current mode.

** Cross-References
- State management patterns established for future functionality
- Visual feedback system can be reused for other features

* Turn 4: Selection Menu Persistence Enhancement
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Implementation Phase 3
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Resolved Priority 3 by removing auto-close behavior and implementing user-controlled workflow with enhanced single-value field handling.

** Changes Made
- Removed auto-close behavior from selection menus
- Enhanced single-value field handling with selection replacement
- Added informative notifications for single-value field behavior
- Maintained user control over workflow completion

** Rationale
Auto-close behavior was disruptive to user workflow, especially for single-value fields. New approach provides full user control while giving clear feedback about field behavior and selection status.

* Turn 5: Menu Hierarchy Navigation Fix
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Architecture Enhancement
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Enhanced navigation system to provide proper hierarchical flow between menus rather than complete closure.

** Changes Made
- Modified closeInstanceMenu to return to field selection menu
- Established proper navigation hierarchy: field → instance/method → back to field
- Enhanced user experience with predictable navigation patterns

** Rationale
Users expected hierarchical navigation rather than complete menu closure. New pattern follows standard UI conventions and provides intuitive navigation flow.

* Turn 6: Multi-Input Method Architecture Implementation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Architecture Extension
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Extended system architecture to support multiple field input methods, addressing user requirement for diverse data entry approaches.

** Changes Made
- Modified selectField function to show method selection menu
- Created createFieldSettingMethodMenu with 4 input methods
- Implemented complete text input functionality
- Added input_method tracking to selection data structure
- Created placeholder implementations for file import and AI extraction

** Rationale
Extensible architecture addresses current text input needs while providing foundation for future enhancements. Method selection approach gives users choice of input approaches based on their specific needs.

** Cross-References
- Data structure enhancements documented in cleanup report
- Input method extension patterns established for future development

* Turn 7: Text Input Implementation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Feature Implementation
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Implemented complete text input functionality with field-appropriate handling for both single-value and multi-value fields.

** Changes Made
- Created createTextInputDialog with field-appropriate sizing
- Implemented saveTextInput with proper data structure handling
- Added support for line-separated multi-value input
- Enhanced selection data with input_method tracking
- Implemented proper save/cancel workflow with menu navigation

** Rationale  
Text input provides essential alternative to page selection, especially useful for fields that don't correspond to visible page elements. Multi-value support with line separation follows common user expectations.

* Turn 8: System Integration and Testing Preparation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Integration Phase
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Integrated all components and prepared system for testing phase. User confirmed successful resolution of all 3 priority issues and requested cleanup for handoff to next model focusing on multi-element subfield management.

** Changes Made
- Verified integration of all enhanced components
- Confirmed proper data structure compatibility
- Validated menu navigation hierarchy
- Prepared system for multi-element subfield management requirements

** Rationale
Complete integration ensures all enhancements work together seamlessly. System ready for next development phase focusing on nested instance management.

** Next Steps Identified
- Multi-element subfield management system implementation
- Instance creation and management with numbered indexing
- Nested navigation hierarchy extension
- Django integration testing
