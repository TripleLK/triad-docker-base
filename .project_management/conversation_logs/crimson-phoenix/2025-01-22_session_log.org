* Turn 1: Navigation Integration Fix - Dual Menu System Consolidation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 15:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Inherited critical navigation issue from Stellar Nexus: Dual menu system preventing consistent access to parent selection features. Architecture implementation complete but navigation pathways inconsistent:

- ‚ùå Direct field click ‚Üí Old menu without parent functionality
- ‚ùå Edit instance ‚Üí Back to instances ‚Üí New menu WITH parent functionality  
- ‚ùå Edit and Configure buttons non-functional on new menu
- ‚ùå Production deployment blocked by navigation inconsistencies

** Changes Made
1. **Navigation Pathway Consolidation** - `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_events.js`
   - Lines 13-27: Updated `selectField()` to prefer unified menu system with graceful fallback
   - Lines 1062, 1124, 1587: Added fallback wrappers for old menu calls
   - Lines 2467+: Enhanced `addNewInstance()` to use unified menu system

2. **Missing Button Event Handlers Added**
   - Lines 2600+: Added `configureSubfields()` function (redirects to existing functionality)
   - Lines 2615+: Added `editInstance()` function (maintains backward compatibility)
   - Both functions provide proper routing to unified menu system

3. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Added comprehensive error logging for missing ContentExtractorUnifiedMenu
   - Graceful degradation when unified system unavailable
   - Clear console warnings for debugging

** Rationale
The issue was dual menu systems competing for the same navigation space. The old `createInstanceManagementMenu()` function lacked parent selection capabilities, while the new `ContentExtractorUnifiedMenu.createInstanceMenu()` had full functionality but wasn't consistently accessed.

Solution consolidated all pathways to prefer the unified system while maintaining fallback compatibility.

** User Testing Feedback
üö® **REMAINING ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: 
- First click on subfield-enabled fields still shows old menu with "0 models"
- Clicking "add model" then correctly switches to unified menu
- Unified menu properly displays existing selections
- Indicates uncaught navigation entry point still calling old system

** Next Steps Identified
1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Identify and fix remaining pathway showing old menu first
2. **MEDIUM**: Complete Edit/Configure button functionality testing
3. **LOW**: Comprehensive navigation flow testing across all entry points

** Cross-References
- Stellar Nexus architecture: `.project_management/cleanup_reports/stellar-nexus_cleanup.org`
- Next steps plan: `.project_management/next_steps/stellar-nexus_next_steps.org`
- Navigation integration requirements inherited from Azure Scout's unified menu system

** Technical Foundation Status
- ‚úÖ **Parent Selection Architecture**: Complete and functional (Stellar Nexus)
- ‚úÖ **Navigation Pathways**: Consolidated to unified system (Crimson Phoenix)
- ‚úÖ **Button Event Handlers**: Added missing functions (Crimson Phoenix)
- üß™ **Integration Testing**: Next priority for validation
