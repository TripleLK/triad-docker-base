* Turn 1: Cursor Rules Enhancement for Conversation Logging Clarity
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 12:00:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User requested modification of cursor rules to make conversation logging requirements clearer
   - User emphasized that logs should be created after EVERY model action, not just major ones
   - User wanted clearer protocol for handling interruptions, with interrupted turn logging as first step
   - Established code name "Crimson Phoenix" for this session
   - Took over from Electric Shark with mandate to continue file organization work afterward

** Changes Made
   - Modified .cursor/rules/02_conversation_logging.mdc:1-95 - Enhanced conversation logging protocol
     * Changed "End-of-Turn Requirement" to "Mandatory Logging After EVERY Model Action"
     * Added explicit list of actions requiring logs (all actions, including minor ones)
     * Added "NO EXCEPTIONS" language for absolute clarity
     * Restructured interruption recovery into clear Step 1/Step 2 format
     * Made logging interrupted turns the "ABSOLUTE FIRST ACTION"
     * Enhanced user signals for interruption detection
     * Strengthened log maintenance requirements
   - Modified .project_management/model_name_tracking.org - Updated tracking document
     * Changed Electric Shark status from "Active" to "Completed"
     * Added comprehensive summary of Electric Shark's contributions
     * Added Crimson Phoenix entry as new active model

** Rationale
   - Original rules were ambiguous about frequency of logging - could be interpreted as only for major actions
   - Interruption protocol needed clearer step-by-step format to ensure consistency
   - Strong emphasis language ("ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED", "NO EXCEPTIONS") eliminates ambiguity
   - Explicit listing of action types ensures comprehensive coverage
   - Step-by-step interruption recovery ensures no work is lost during handoffs

** Cross-References
   - Built on Electric Shark's work: .project_management/cleanup_reports/electric-shark_cleanup.org
   - Next steps to follow: .project_management/next_steps/electric-shark_next_steps.org
   - Previous logging enhancements by Swift Penguin in same file

** Next Steps Identified
   - Continue with Electric Shark's file organization priorities (remaining root directory cleanup)
   - Verify import dependencies for moved files
   - Complete archive system for remaining analysis outputs
   - Use established git automation script for organized commits 

* Turn 2: Cursor Rules Restructuring and Turn Completion Marker Implementation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 12:15:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User requested addition of mandatory turn completion marker for automatic interruption detection
   - User wanted mdc files restructured to be smaller and more focused with clear organization
   - Implemented automatic interruption detection using [SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED MODEL TURN] marker
   - Broke down large mdc files into 8 focused files covering specific rule areas
   - Created index file for easy navigation of new rule structure

** Changes Made
   - Created .cursor/rules/00_rules_index.mdc - Overview and navigation guide for new rule structure
   - Created .cursor/rules/01_basic_protocols.mdc - Turn completion marker, code names, interruption detection
   - Modified .cursor/rules/02_conversation_logging.mdc - Streamlined to focus only on logging requirements
   - Created .cursor/rules/03_directory_structure.mdc - Directory compliance and file location rules
   - Created .cursor/rules/04_naming_conventions.mdc - File naming and documentation standards
   - Created .cursor/rules/05_change_management.mdc - Autonomous vs discussion-required changes
   - Created .cursor/rules/06_django_specific.mdc - Django project context and protection rules
   - Created .cursor/rules/07_testing_protocols.mdc - Web testing limitations and code testing standards
   - Deleted old consolidated files:
     * .cursor/rules/01_code_name_protocol.mdc (moved to basic_protocols)
     * .cursor/rules/04_file_management.mdc (broken into multiple focused files)
     * .cursor/rules/ai_behavior.mdc (broken into multiple focused files)

** Rationale
   - Turn completion marker enables automatic interruption detection vs relying on user signals
   - Smaller focused files are easier to navigate, maintain, and reference
   - Functional organization makes rules easier to find and update independently
   - Index file provides clear overview and navigation guide for new structure
   - Reduced file sizes improve readability and reduce cognitive load
   - Modular approach allows adding new rule categories without cluttering existing files

** Cross-References
   - Previous rule enhancements by Swift Penguin and Electric Shark
   - Builds on established conversation logging and cleanup protocols
   - Supports continued file organization work from Electric Shark's next steps

** Next Steps Identified
   - Rules structure now ready to support continued development work
   - Next focus should be on Electric Shark's file organization priorities
   - Turn completion marker should eliminate interruption detection issues going forward 

* Turn 3: Next Steps Creation and Conditional Cursor Rules Planning
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 12:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User requested creation of next steps file to preserve Electric Shark's file organization work information
   - User wants cursor rules to be conditional rather than applied to ALL chats 
   - User requested planning for "Agent Requested" rules with clear use case descriptions
   - User wanted grouping by functional purpose with tracking file for rule applications
   - User requested adding rule about updating tracking index when new rules are added

** Changes Made
   - Created .project_management/next_steps/crimson-phoenix_next_steps.org - Comprehensive handoff document
     * Preserved Electric Shark's file organization progress and context
     * Detailed remaining work: root directory cleanup, import verification, archive completion
     * Listed essential context: git automation ready, directory structure established
     * Documented user clarifications and decision points for next model
   - Created .cursor/rules/rule_application_tracking.org - Conditional rule application system
     * Classified rules as "Always Applied" vs "Agent Requested"
     * Defined application triggers and keywords for each rule
     * Created rule combination strategies for common task types
     * Established maintenance protocol and success metrics
   - Created .cursor/rules/08_rule_maintenance.mdc - Rule system maintenance protocols
     * Mandatory tracking index updates when creating/modifying rules
     * Rule creation standards and quality requirements
     * Maintenance workflow for adding, modifying, removing rules
   - Updated .cursor/rules/rule_application_tracking.org - Added new maintenance rule entry
   - Updated .cursor/rules/00_rules_index.mdc - Added maintenance rule to index

** Rationale
   - Next steps file preserves critical context from Electric Shark before it gets buried in history
   - Conditional rule application reduces cognitive load while maintaining rule effectiveness
   - Clear classification helps models request only relevant rules for their tasks
   - Rule combination strategies provide guidance for common task scenarios
   - Maintenance protocols ensure rule system integrity and prevent orphaned rules

   - Based on Electric Shark's work: .project_management/cleanup_reports/electric-shark_cleanup.org
   - Incorporates Electric Shark's next steps: .project_management/next_steps/electric-shark_next_steps.org
   - Builds on cursor rules restructuring from Turn 2

** Next Steps Identified
   - Rule system now ready for conditional application in cursor IDE
   - Only basic protocols and conversation logging should remain "Always Applied"
   - All other rules can be set to "Agent Requested" with clear trigger criteria
   - Next model can focus on completing Electric Shark's file organization work with appropriate rules 

* Turn 4: Rule Application Adjustments - Turn-Based and IDE Directive Focus
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 12:45:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User clarified that rule request instructions aren't needed - IDE handles this internally
   - User wants focus on providing clear directives for IDE configuration
   - User clarified rules apply turn-by-turn, not session-wide
   - Adjusted rule tracking to focus on what user needs to configure conditional application

** Changes Made
   - Modified .cursor/rules/rule_application_tracking.org - Streamlined for IDE directive focus
     * Removed "How to Request Rules" section - IDE handles this internally
     * Removed "Rule Combination Strategies" section - not needed for IDE configuration
     * Changed timing from "session-based" to "turn-based" application
     * Converted "Request Keywords" to "IDE Directive" format for user configuration
     * Simplified maintenance protocol to focus on rule creation and directive definition

** Rationale
   - User doesn't need models to know how to request rules - IDE manages this automatically
   - Turn-based application is more precise and flexible than session-wide rules
   - IDE directives give user exact criteria needed for conditional configuration
   - Simplified format focuses on essential information for rule management

** Cross-References
   - Builds on conditional rule system from Turn 3
