* Turn 2: Model Settings and Amazon Bedrock Recommendations
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Previous work]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested optimal model settings and Bedrock model recommendations for structured data generation.

** Response Provided
- Temperature: 0.2 for consistent JSON structure with natural variation
- Top P: 0.9 for focused but diverse content generation
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet recommendation for best JSON adherence and instruction following

** Rationale

* Turn 3: Batch Processing Issues and Token Limit Solutions
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Previous work]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User tested multiple models with SafeFUME data showing incomplete results due to token limits. LLama processed all 9 models but was cut off due to 2048 token limit. Other models stopped early despite having higher limits.

** Analysis Provided
- Issue isn't capability but conservative early stopping
- Recommended batch processing approach with model subset splitting
- Added batch processing instructions to AI prompt

** Changes Made
- Enhanced AI prompt with batch processing mode sections
- Added model subset processing instructions
- Included batch coordination fields

* Turn 4: Two-Mode Processing Implementation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Current turn]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested implementation of two distinct processing modes:
- "Overall Details" mode: Everything except models_data, with universal specifications
- "Model Subset" mode: Only models_data, excluding universal specifications
- Need for interactive content extractor to extract model names
- JSON exporter to create appropriate number of files with correct content modes

** Changes Made
- Updated .project_management/ai_prompts/ai_json_to_lab_equipment_api.md:
  - Restructured to have three distinct modes: Overall Details, Model Subset, Complete Processing
  - Clear specification separation rules between universal and model-specific specs
  - Cross-mode consistency requirements to prevent duplication
  - Enhanced validation checklists for each mode

- Updated apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py:
  - Added extract_model_names_from_selections() method
  - Enhanced get_all_field_selections() for better organization
  - Support for extracting model names from nested selections

- Updated apps/content_extractor/management/commands/export_ai_json.py:
  - Added two-mode processing export format
  - Automatic model name extraction from records
  - Batch splitting for model subsets based on models-per-batch parameter
  - Field filtering for model-specific vs universal fields
  - Proper file naming for overall details and model subset batches

** Rationale
This implementation solves the token limit issue by separating equipment data into two focused processing modes, allowing for complete data processing while staying within model limitations. The clear separation prevents specification duplication and ensures comprehensive coverage of all equipment details.

** Next Steps Identified
- Test the two-mode processing with SafeFUME data
- Validate proper field separation between modes
- Ensure batch coordination works correctly for multiple model subsets 

* Turn 5: Two-Mode Processing Clarifications and Model Name Fields
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Current turn]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User provided important clarifications for two-mode processing:
1. Always separate models - remove complete processing mode option
2. Remove model name inference from export command - rely only on content extractor
3. Fix metadata handling to be all-or-nothing approach
4. User discovered model name fields were missing from content extractor field choices

** Changes Made
- Updated .project_management/ai_prompts/ai_json_to_lab_equipment_api.md:
  - Removed MODE 3 (Complete Processing) to make it always two-mode
  - Added clear statement that prompt is designed for two-mode processing only
  - Simplified approach to always separate overall details and model subsets

- Updated apps/content_extractor/management/commands/export_ai_json.py:
  - Removed --model-names command line parameter 
  - Removed model name inference logic from extract_model_names_from_record()
  - Made two-mode processing the default format (was individual)
  - Changed individual format to legacy-individual to discourage use
  - Fixed metadata handling with create_complete_export_metadata() - all metadata or none
  - Clear error message when no model names found requiring content extractor

- Updated apps/content_extractor/models.py:
  - Added 'model_name' and 'name' fields to LAB_EQUIPMENT_FIELD_CHOICES
  - These fields are now available in content extractor for model name selection

- Created migration apps/content_extractor/migrations/0009_add_model_name_fields.py:
  - Applied database migration to support new field choices

** Rationale
These changes eliminate complexity and potential errors by:
1. **Enforcing separation**: Always splitting equipment data into overall details and model subsets
2. **Removing inference**: Only accepting explicitly extracted model names from content extractor
3. **Consistent metadata**: Either include all metadata fields or none to avoid partial data issues
4. **Required fields**: Adding model name fields to content extractor so users can actually select them

** Technical Impact
- Export command now requires model names to be extracted via interactive content selector
- Two-mode processing becomes the standard workflow, not an option
- Cleaner metadata structure with complete information when requested
- Content extractor now supports the fields needed for two-mode processing

** Next Steps Identified
- Test model name extraction using new model_name and name fields in content extractor
- Verify two-mode processing works with extracted model names
- Test complete metadata export functionality 

* Turn 6: Fixed Model Name Field in Interactive Selector
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Current turn]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User reported that "model names" was still not available as a field option when running `python manage.py interactive_selector`, despite adding it to the database model field choices.

** Problem Identified
The interactive selector doesn't get field choices from the database model. Instead, it uses the `SelectionContext.get_available_fields()` method in `selection_context.py` which has its own hardcoded field definitions.

** Changes Made
- Updated apps/content_extractor/selectors/selection_context.py:
  - Added `SelectionField('model_name', 'Model Name', 'multi-value', 'Individual model names for extraction (select all models)', color='#ffa07a')` to the root level fields in get_available_fields() method
  - Changed from 'single' to 'multi-value' type since we need to extract multiple model names from each page
  - Now the model_name field will appear in the interactive selector's Multi Value Fields section

** Rationale
The interactive selector uses the NestedSelectionManager which gets its field list from SelectionContext, not from the Django model field choices. Adding the field to both locations ensures consistency between the database schema and the interactive interface.

** Technical Impact
- Model Name field is now available for selection in the interactive content extractor
- Users can extract model names directly using the visual selector interface
- Export command can now receive model names extracted via the content extractor
- Two-mode processing workflow is fully supported

** Next Steps Identified
- Test that Model Name field now appears in interactive selector menu
- Extract model names for SafeFUME equipment using the interactive selector
- Test full two-mode processing workflow with extracted model names
