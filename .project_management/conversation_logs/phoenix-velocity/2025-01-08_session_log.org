* Turn 9: Major Direction Change - Active Work Tracking Update
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 22:45:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- User provided comprehensive new implementation plan
- **MAJOR DIRECTION CHANGE**: Eliminate AI step completely
- Focus on human field selection for LabEquipmentPage model
- Expand floating menu for field-specific selection
- Multi-value fields: select 2 examples, generate generalized selector
- Save complex multi-page product handling for later (adamequipment.com example)

** Changes Made
- **COMPLETELY REWROTE** `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org`
  - Updated project objective to field-specific selection
  - Added all LabEquipmentPage fields as selection targets
  - Restructured implementation plan around field selection
  - Added multi-value field generalization approach
  - Moved complex scenarios to "Future Considerations"
  - Updated success criteria and technical architecture
  - Marked foundation as complete, ready for field enhancement

** Rationale
- User clarified they want pure human-driven field assignment
- Current interactive selector provides foundation for field-specific selection
- Multi-value field handling requires generalized selector generation
- Complex multi-page scenarios deferred to focus on core functionality
- Zero AI processing aligns with user's preference for human control

** Next Steps Identified
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Implement floating field selection menu in interactive selector
2. **PHASE 1**: Add multi-value field generalization capability
3. **PHASE 2**: Build field completion tracking and management commands
4. **USER APPROVAL**: Ensure new direction aligns with expectations before implementation
