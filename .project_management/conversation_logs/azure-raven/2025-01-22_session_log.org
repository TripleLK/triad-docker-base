* Turn 1: Bug Analysis and Initial Planning
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Taking over from Quantum Pulse to fix 4 critical bugs in the multi-URL testing functionality:
1. Initial URL count shows 0 URLs instead of current URL
2. Add URL shows error despite success
3. Close button non-functional in Add URL dialog
4. URL navigation breaks JavaScript loading

** Analysis Completed
- Reviewed URL management JavaScript functions in content_extractor_selection.js
- Examined backend API endpoints in url_management_views.py
- Checked SiteConfiguration model methods for URL handling
- Identified root causes for each bug

** Root Causes Identified
1. **URL Count Bug**: get_test_urls_view returns empty list when no SiteConfiguration exists, doesn't auto-include current URL
2. **Add URL Error**: SiteConfiguration.add_test_url() doesn't return success/failure dict as expected by backend
3. **Close Button Bug**: Modal selector in closeAddUrlDialog() too specific, doesn't find modal reliably
4. **JavaScript Loading**: No re-injection mechanism for new pages after URL switching

** Changes Made

*** Bug #1 Fix: Initial URL Count Shows Current URL
**** Files Modified
- `apps/content_extractor/url_management_views.py` - get_test_urls_view function
- `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_selection.js` - loadUrlCount function

**** Changes
- Backend now accepts `current_url` parameter and auto-includes it if not in test URLs
- JavaScript passes current URL to backend for auto-inclusion
- Ensures URL count shows at least 1 (current URL) on page load

*** Bug #2 Fix: Add URL Success Response
**** Files Modified
- `apps/content_extractor/models.py` - SiteConfiguration.add_test_url method

**** Changes
- Method now returns proper success/failure dict instead of raising exceptions
- Handles URL validation and duplicate detection gracefully
- Provides clear success/error messages for frontend

*** Bug #3 Fix: Close Button Functionality
**** Files Modified
- `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_selection.js` - showAddUrlDialog and closeAddUrlDialog functions

**** Changes
- Added specific modal ID ('add-url-modal') for reliable selection
- Improved escape key handler cleanup
- Added console logging for debugging
- More robust modal closing logic

*** Bug #4 Fix: JavaScript Persistence Across URL Navigation
**** Files Modified
- `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_selection.js` - switchTestUrl and initializeInterface functions

**** Changes
- Store essential data in sessionStorage before URL switch
- Auto-detect URL switch on page load via sessionStorage
- Re-initialize JavaScript with preserved data
- Maintains API token and configuration across page loads

** Next Steps Identified
Ready for testing all bug fixes to verify they work correctly 

* Turn 2: Testing Results and Remaining Fixes
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 15:45:00
  :END:

** Testing Results
User tested the bug fixes with following results:
- ✅ Bug #3: Close button now works properly
- ✅ Bug #2: Add URL saving works and shows success
- ❌ Bug #4: Next/Prev buttons take you to raw page without overlay
- ❌ Bug #1: Sites still start with 0 URLs  
- ❌ CORS: External sites (adamequipment.com) get CORS errors

** Root Cause Analysis
*** Bug #4: JavaScript Re-injection Issue
- My sessionStorage approach doesn't work because new page has no JavaScript at all
- Need interactive selector to detect URL switches and re-inject automatically
- window.location.href navigation goes to completely raw page

*** Bug #1: URL Count Still 0
- Backend fix not working - need to debug why current URL not included
- Possible issue with domain matching or URL parsing

*** CORS Issue
- Django API endpoints need CORS headers for external sites
- Need to add django-cors-headers configuration

** Next Actions
Fix remaining issues with proper solutions 

* Turn 3: Complete Bug Fixes Implementation  
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:15:00
  :END:

** Fixes Implemented

*** CORS Headers Fix
**** Files Modified
- `apps/content_extractor/url_management_views.py` - All API endpoints

**** Changes
- Added `add_cors_headers()` function for proper CORS support
- Added OPTIONS method handling to all endpoints
- Added CORS headers to all JSON responses
- Enables external sites (like adamequipment.com) to make API calls

*** Bug #1 Fix: URL Count Domain Matching
**** Files Modified  
- `apps/content_extractor/url_management_views.py` - get_test_urls_view function

**** Changes
- Improved domain matching logic to handle www prefixes and subdomains
- More flexible URL validation for auto-including current URL
- Better logging for debugging domain matching issues

*** Bug #4 Fix: Proper URL Switching via Interactive Selector
**** Files Modified
- `apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_selection.js` - switchTestUrl function
- `apps/content_extractor/selectors/navigation_manager.py` - Added URL switching support
- `apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py` - Updated NavigationManager initialization

**** Changes
- JavaScript now uses pendingAction pattern instead of direct navigation
- Added 'switch_url' action type to navigation manager
- Added handle_url_switch method to process URL switching via interactive selector
- InteractiveSelector now handles browser navigation and JavaScript re-injection automatically
- Removed sessionStorage reinjection logic (no longer needed)

** Technical Approach
- JavaScript sets pendingAction for URL switch instead of navigating directly
- Interactive selector polls for pending actions and processes them
- URL switching uses built-in switch_to_next_url/switch_to_previous_url methods
- Browser navigation and JavaScript re-injection handled seamlessly by InteractiveSelector

** Testing Required
All 4 bugs should now be fixed:
1. ✅ Initial URL count should show current URL (improved domain matching)
2. ✅ Add URL should show success (already working)
3. ✅ Close button should work (already working)  
4. ✅ URL navigation should maintain JavaScript overlay (via pending actions)
5. ✅ CORS errors should be resolved (added CORS headers)
