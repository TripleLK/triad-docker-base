* Turn 1: Image Investigation Request
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Session Start
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User reported that images were not working despite nested object creation being fixed. Requested investigation of image handling in AI JSON import system, specifically checking contents of Claude 3.7 Sonnet and two_mode folders for image data.

** Analysis Performed
- Examined AI JSON files in both folders
- Investigated image data structure and processing flow
- Identified gap between raw data extraction and AI conversion prompt

** Key Findings
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet folder: Contains only ~alt_text_suggestions~, no actual image URLs
- Two_mode folder: Contains actual image URLs in ~gallery_images.extracted_content[].extracted_data[].html~
- AI conversion prompt missing image extraction instructions
- Import system ready for images but not receiving ~image_urls~ field

* Turn 2: Root Cause Analysis
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Mid-session
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Deep investigation into image data flow revealed the conversion prompt was not extracting actual image URLs from the raw gallery_images HTML content. Found specific image URLs in SafeFUME data.

** Changes Made
Updated ~.project_management/ai_prompts/ai_json_to_lab_equipment_api.md~:
- Added comprehensive image processing section
- Instructions for extracting URLs from gallery_images HTML
- Convert relative URLs to full URLs using site_domain
- Generate both image_urls and alt_text_suggestions fields
- Updated validation checklist for image processing

** Technical Discovery
- Image URLs found: ~/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PDT_CA30S_Right.png~
- Raw data structure: HTML content with <img src="..."> tags
- Expected output: Array of full URLs for download system
- Integration point: LabEquipmentGalleryImage model supports both internal and external images

** Rationale
The AI conversion prompt needed explicit instructions to extract image URLs from HTML content and convert them to downloadable format. The existing prompt only generated alt text suggestions but ignored the actual image sources.

* Turn 3: Cleanup and Handoff Preparation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Session End
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested cleanup due to long context window and preparation for next model to implement image download functionality.

** Changes Made
- Created comprehensive cleanup report documenting investigation and findings
- Created detailed next steps file with implementation plan
- Updated conversation log with complete session documentation

** Next Steps Identified
1. Implement image download utility function
2. Update import command to process image_urls field  
3. Enhance serializer to handle image download during import
4. Add error handling and testing for image operations

** Handoff Context
- Prompt successfully updated to extract image URLs
- Technical architecture documented and ready
- Clear implementation plan provided
- Test data identified for verification

* Architecture Impact
** Database Schema
- LabEquipmentGalleryImage model supports required functionality
- Wagtail Image system integration available
- Gallery ordering and display logic in place

** API Integration
- Serializers have infrastructure for image processing
- Frontend has CORS fallback handling implemented
- Image download functionality gap identified and documented

** Critical Success Factors
- Image URLs must be extracted from gallery_images HTML
- Full URLs required (relative paths converted using site_domain)
- Wagtail Image objects must be created for optimal performance
- Graceful error handling for network failures essential
