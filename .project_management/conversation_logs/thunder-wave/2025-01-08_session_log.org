* Turn 1: Django Ninja API v3 Unit Test Creation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 15:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - Received handoff from Crystal Harbor to create unit tests for Django Ninja API v3
   - Analyzed existing API structure and endpoints from handoff documentation
   - Identified 5 main endpoint categories requiring comprehensive testing
   - Planned comprehensive test suite covering unit and integration testing

** Changes Made
   - Created tests/unit/test_django_ninja_api.py - Comprehensive unit tests for all API endpoints
   - Created tests/integration/test_api_workflows.py - Integration tests for complete workflows
   - Created tests/test_runner.py - Custom test runner with API-specific configurations
   - Created tests/__init__.py - Test package initialization
   - Created tests/unit/__init__.py - Unit test package initialization  
   - Created tests/integration/__init__.py - Integration test package initialization
   - Created tests/README.md - Complete test suite documentation

** Test Coverage Implemented

*** Unit Tests (test_django_ninja_api.py)
    - SystemEndpointsTest: Health check and test endpoints
    - EquipmentEndpointsTest: Equipment listing, detail, and related equipment
    - ModelsEndpointsTest: Equipment models functionality
    - TagsEndpointsTest: Categorized tags functionality
    - APIErrorHandlingTest: Error handling and edge cases
    - WagtailCompatibilityTest: Wagtail Page inheritance compatibility
    - APIPerformanceTest: Query efficiency and performance monitoring
    - APIDocumentationTest: Schema generation and documentation

*** Integration Tests (test_api_workflows.py)
    - APIWorkflowIntegrationTest: Complete user workflows
    - Error handling across multiple requests
    - Pagination workflows across different endpoints

*** Test Infrastructure
    - Custom test runner with API-specific configurations
    - Proper Wagtail Page creation patterns for test data
    - Realistic test data setup with equipment, models, tags, and relationships
    - Performance testing with query count assertions
    - Documentation generation testing

** Technical Challenges Resolved
   - Fixed Wagtail Page model instantiation in tests using proper add_child() pattern
   - Implemented proper Site and root page setup for Wagtail testing
   - Created flexible field assignment for LabEquipmentPage model variations
   - Designed test data that mirrors real-world equipment relationships

** API Endpoints Tested
   - GET /api/v3/health - System health check with database connectivity
   - GET /api/v3/test - Basic functionality verification
   - GET /api/v3/equipment - Equipment listing with pagination
   - GET /api/v3/equipment/{id} - Equipment detail view
   - GET /api/v3/equipment/{id}/related - Related equipment by tags/specs
   - GET /api/v3/models - Equipment models with filtering
   - GET /api/v3/tags - Categorized tags with category filtering

** Test Quality Features
   - Comprehensive error handling testing (404s, invalid parameters, malformed requests)
   - Wagtail compatibility testing (page_ptr_id aliasing, backwards queries)
   - Performance testing (query count monitoring, response time validation)
   - Real-world workflow testing (complete equipment discovery, tag relationships)
   - Documentation testing (schema generation, endpoint accessibility)

** Rationale
   - Created comprehensive test suite to ensure Django Ninja API v3 migration reliability
   - Focused on Wagtail compatibility issues that were core to the migration
   - Implemented both unit and integration testing for complete coverage
   - Added performance testing to prevent regression during development
   - Created proper test infrastructure for future API development

** Cross-References
   - Builds on Crystal Harbor's Django Ninja API v3 implementation
   - References Steady Circuit's original API architecture
   - Connects to active work tracking objectives for API testing completion
   - Links to triad_project_architecture.org for API documentation

** Next Steps Identified
   - Run complete test suite to verify all tests pass
   - Add any missing test cases discovered during execution
   - Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline if available
   - Document test results and coverage metrics
   - Create test data fixtures for consistent testing across environments
