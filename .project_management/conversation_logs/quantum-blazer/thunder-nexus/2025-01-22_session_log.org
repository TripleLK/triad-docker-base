* Turn 1: Subfield Menu Unification & XPath Integration
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [10:00:00]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested that subfield menus work exactly like main field menus, with full XPath editing capabilities. Previously, subfields had limited functionality and couldn't modify XPath expressions. User also mentioned positioning issue where subfield menus were horizontally aligned with main field instead of being properly centered.

Key requirements:
- Subfield menus should use same functions as main field menus
- XPath editing must be available for all subfields
- User wants to override entire model specs with XPath for each model
- Fix horizontal alignment positioning issue

** Changes Made
Updated content_extractor_events.js:
- Lines 955-1100: Modified selectSubfield() function to use unified menu system with XPath editing
- Added openSubfieldXPathEditor() helper function for proper XPath editor integration
- Updated subfield selection flow to match main field functionality

Updated content_extractor_xpath_editor.js:
- Lines 940-1000: Enhanced saveXPath() function to handle subfield contexts
- Added saveSubfieldXPath() and saveFieldXPath() helper functions
- Updated XPath saving logic to properly store subfield XPath data

Updated content_extractor_unified_menu.js:
- Lines 80-120: Enhanced createMenu() function to ensure proper menu cleanup and positioning
- Added ensureProperMenuStacking() function to prevent positioning conflicts
- Improved menu cleanup to close existing menus before creating new ones

** Rationale
The original subfield implementation was using a different flow and didn't integrate with the unified menu system or XPath editor. The positioning issue was likely caused by multiple menus being shown simultaneously. By making subfields use the exact same functions and flow as main fields, users now have consistent XPath editing capabilities across all menu types.

** Testing Status
Django development server started on port 8001 for live testing of the updated functionality.

** Next Steps Identified
- Test subfield XPath editing functionality
- Verify positioning fixes
- Ensure subfield selections save properly to the correct data structure
- Validate that subfield menus work identically to main field menus
