* Turn 1: Architectural Pivot Planning
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested complete pivot away from Crimson Phoenix's complex parent/subfield navigation system. New directive: "All fields should just go to the 'how to set' menu followed by the selections interface like in the images." This represents a major simplification eliminating all subfield/instance complexity.

** Changes Made
- Updated .project_management/active_work_tracking.org - Replaced complex navigation project with simplified field system
- Updated .project_management/model_name_tracking.org - Added Thunder Cascade with architectural pivot mission
- Started conversation log documentation

** Rationale
The complex parent/subfield architecture was causing navigation inconsistencies and user confusion. The simplified approach will provide uniform experience regardless of field complexity, storing all data as XPath lists with optional comments.

** Next Steps Identified
1. Modify selectField() function to route ALL fields to method menu
2. Update data structures for simplified XPath storage
3. Implement uniform interface components
4. Remove deprecated subfield/instance management code

* Turn 2: Implementation Planning Complete
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 15:45:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Analyzed current codebase structure, identified createFieldSettingMethodMenu as existing "how to set" interface. Found selectField() function currently routes complex fields to instance management but simple fields to method menu. Need to modify this to route ALL fields to method menu first.

** Current System Analysis
- ✅ createFieldSettingMethodMenu() already exists with proper interface
- ✅ Shows 4 options: Select from Page, Enter Text, Import File, AI Extraction
- ✅ "Select from Page Elements" option leads to selections interface
- ❌ selectField() function has conditional routing based on has_sub_fields

** Changes Made
- Analyzed apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_events.js
- Analyzed apps/content_extractor/static/js/content_extractor_ui.js  
- Documented current createFieldSettingMethodMenu implementation
- Prepared implementation strategy

** Rationale
Understanding current system is critical before making changes. The "how to set" menu already exists and works well - just need to ensure ALL fields use it instead of complex routing logic.

** Next Steps Identified
- Modify selectField() function to always call createFieldSettingMethodMenu()
- Remove has_sub_fields conditional routing
- Update startPageSelection() to work uniformly for all field types
- Simplify data storage to XPath lists + comments

* Turn 3: Core Implementation Complete
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 16:00:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Successfully implemented the simplified field selection approach. All fields now route to the same "how to set" menu regardless of complexity. Added comment functionality for AI context. The system now provides uniform experience for all field types.

** Changes Made
- Modified selectField() function in content_extractor_events.js - Removed has_sub_fields conditional logic
- Added comment functionality to createFieldSettingMethodMenu in content_extractor_ui.js
- Implemented addFieldComment, saveFieldComment, cancelFieldComment functions in content_extractor_events.js
- Added createFieldCommentDialog function in content_extractor_ui.js
- Restored createTextInputDialog function that was accidentally replaced
- Updated field setting method menu to display existing comments

** Architecture Changes
- ✅ ALL fields now use: Field click → "How to Set" menu → Selections interface
- ✅ Added comment system for AI context with preview in method menu
- ✅ Simplified selectField() routing - no more complex subfield logic
- ✅ Uniform user experience regardless of field complexity
- ✅ Maintained existing text input and page selection functionality

** Technical Implementation
```javascript
// Simplified selectField function
function selectField(fieldName) {
    const field = window.contentExtractorData.fieldOptions.find(f => f.name === fieldName);
    if (!field) return;
    
    // ALL fields now use the same workflow
    console.log(`🎯 Thunder Cascade: Routing ${fieldName} to method selection menu (uniform workflow)`);
    createFieldSettingMethodMenu(fieldName);
}
```

** Rationale
Eliminated the complex parent/subfield navigation that was causing user confusion. The simplified approach provides consistent workflow while maintaining all functionality through the existing "Select from Page Elements" → selections interface pathway.

** Next Steps Identified
- Test system with complex fields to ensure page selection works correctly
- Consider adding XPath generalization features for AI optimization
- Update database models for simplified storage approach
- Clean up deprecated subfield/instance management code
