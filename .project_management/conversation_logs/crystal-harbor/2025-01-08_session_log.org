* Session Overview
Crystal Harbor completed the Django Ninja API migration by resolving the critical
database query issue that was preventing the related equipment endpoint from functioning.

** Mission: Complete Django Ninja API Migration
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All 5 endpoints now functional
- **Critical Issue**: Related equipment endpoint database query failure
- **Solution**: Modified query approach to work around Wagtail Page inheritance limitations

* Turn 1: Diagnosis and Problem Investigation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Start of session]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- Analyzed the handoff documentation from previous Crystal Harbor session
- Identified that 4/5 endpoints were working, with related equipment endpoint failing
- Error: "no such column: base_site_labequipmentpage.id" in database queries

** Investigation Performed
- Used Django shell to test various query patterns
- Examined database schema using sqlite3 to understand table structure
- Discovered that base_site_labequipmentpage table only has page_ptr_id, not id
- Found that Wagtail Page inheritance creates complex multi-table schema

** Key Discovery
The issue was that Django ORM was trying to use 'id' field in joins, but Wagtail's
multi-table inheritance means child tables only have 'page_ptr_id' field.

* Turn 2: Solution Development and Implementation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Mid-session]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- User correctly identified that both filter and exclude clauses needed modification
- Attempted multiple query pattern approaches
- Found that direct foreign key traversal was problematic with Wagtail inheritance

** Approaches Tested
1. Using page_ptr_id in exclude clause only - failed
2. Using page_ptr__ in filter traversal - failed (OneToOneField limitation)
3. Working through parent Page model - failed (relationship not on Page)
4. **SUCCESSFUL**: Working backwards from tags using CategorizedPageTag model directly

** Final Solution
```python
# Work backwards from tags to equipment IDs
related_page_ids = CategorizedPageTag.objects.filter(
    tag_id__in=equipment_tag_ids
).exclude(
    content_object_id=equipment_id  # Exclude current equipment
).values_list('content_object_id', flat=True).distinct()[:10]

# Filter to LabEquipmentPage instances
related_by_tags = LabEquipmentPage.objects.filter(
    id__in=related_page_ids
)[:5]
```

* Turn 3: Testing and Validation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [End of session]
  :END:

** Testing Results
- ✅ Django shell query test: No database errors
- ✅ API endpoint test: Returns proper JSON response
- ✅ All 5 endpoints confirmed working:
  - /api/v3/health ✅
  - /api/v3/test ✅  
  - /api/v3/equipment ✅
  - /api/v3/equipment/{id} ✅
  - /api/v3/equipment/{id}/related ✅

** Changes Made
- Modified api.py related equipment endpoint query approach
- Added import for CategorizedPageTag model
- Implemented backwards query pattern that avoids Wagtail inheritance issues

** Rationale
The backwards approach works because:
1. CategorizedPageTag has direct access to tag_id and content_object_id
2. No complex joins with child table inheritance issues
3. Simple filtering by IDs avoids ORM relationship traversal problems

* Final Status: Mission Accomplished ✅

The Django Ninja API migration is now 100% complete. All endpoints are functional
and the critical database query issue has been resolved.

**Next Steps for Future Models:**
1. Create comprehensive unit test suite
2. Validate API feature parity with DRF v2
3. Performance testing and optimization
4. Documentation and migration guide creation
