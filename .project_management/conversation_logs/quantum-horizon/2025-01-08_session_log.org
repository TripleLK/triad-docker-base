* Session Overview
Quantum Horizon taking over from Azure Phoenix to implement nested object selection architecture for the interactive content selector. Azure Phoenix successfully resolved API issues and provided handoff context for continuing Stellar Horizon's architectural work on modular, recursive selection system.

* Turn 1: Handoff Analysis and Architecture Review
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [13:45:00]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- Established Quantum Horizon code name (quantum/horizon - both unique components) 
- Reviewed active work tracking showing completed foundation with need for nested selection enhancement
- Analyzed Azure Phoenix's successful API fix completion (16/16 tests passing)
- Studied Stellar Horizon's architectural insights about nested selection contexts
- User confirmed focus on "nested object selection" - specifically the need for recursive, modular design

** Architecture Analysis
Based on documentation review, current state:
- ✅ **Foundation Complete**: Interactive selector with field-specific assignment working
- ✅ **Field Selection Menu**: Floating menu with all LabEquipmentPage fields
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Field-specific highlighting and persistent selection indicators  
- ✅ **Multi-value Support**: Basic handling for fields requiring multiple examples

**Critical Gap Identified**: Current implementation uses linear field selection rather than nested context approach

** User Requirements (From Stellar Horizon Documentation)
- **Nested Selection Contexts**: When selecting "models", enter models-specific mode with sub-field options
- **Recursive Interface**: Same selection interface reusable at any nesting depth  
- **Modular Components**: Selection components that can be embedded recursively
- **Visual Depth Indicators**: Border colors or other cues to show selection depth
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain parent selections while navigating sub-selections

** Next Steps Identified
1. **Phase 2A**: Modularize current selection interface into reusable components
2. **Phase 2B**: Implement nested selection contexts with recursive capability
3. **Phase 2C**: Add visual depth indicators and context navigation

** Files Modified This Turn
- `.project_management/conversation_logs/quantum-horizon/2025-01-08_session_log.org` - Created session log
- `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org` - Will update with Quantum Horizon entry

** Rationale
- Following established AI collaboration protocols with proper handoff documentation
- Clear understanding of user requirements for nested selection architecture
- Foundation is solid, ready to implement architectural enhancement per Stellar Horizon's design insights 

* Turn 2: Nested Object Selection Architecture Implementation Completed
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Current Time]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
Successfully implemented the complete nested object selection architecture as requested. The system now supports recursive selection contexts where selecting nested fields like "models" opens model-specific sub-contexts with appropriate field options (name, model_number, spec_groups). The interface reuses the same selection components at any depth level with proper visual hierarchy indicators.

** Key Architecture Components Implemented

*** 1. Modular Selection Context System (`selection_context.py`)
- **SelectionField dataclass**: Defines field properties with type ('single', 'multi-value', 'nested'), colors, and sub-field relationships
- **SelectionResult dataclass**: Captures selection data with context path and depth information  
- **SelectionContext class**: Recursive context management with breadcrumb navigation and depth tracking
- **NestedSelectionManager**: Overall context orchestration with enter/exit navigation

*** 2. Enhanced Interactive Selector Integration
- **Dynamic field options**: JavaScript receives current context fields instead of static FIELD_OPTIONS
- **Depth-based visual styling**: Border colors, widths, and patterns change with nesting depth
- **Enhanced UI elements**: Breadcrumb navigation, depth indicators, parent navigation buttons
- **Event-driven architecture**: JavaScript events trigger Python callbacks for context changes

*** 3. Comprehensive Nested Field Definitions
- **models**: Contains name, model_number, and nested spec_groups
- **spec_groups**: Contains name and multi-value specs (key-value pairs)  
- **Visual hierarchy**: Each depth level uses distinct colors (blue→red→orange→green→purple)
- **Recursive support**: Same interface pattern at any depth level

** Changes Made

*** Files Created
- `apps/content_extractor/selectors/selection_context.py` (334 lines) - Complete nested selection architecture
- `apps/content_extractor/management/commands/test_nested_selector.py` (201 lines) - Comprehensive test suite

*** Files Enhanced  
- `apps/content_extractor/selectors/interactive_selector.py` - Major integration enhancements:
  - Added NestedSelectionManager integration 
  - Enhanced JavaScript with depth-based styling and breadcrumb navigation
  - Added 6 new methods for nested context management
  - Added event listeners for JavaScript→Python communication
  - Enhanced field validation for context-aware field checking

** Technical Implementation Details

*** JavaScript Enhancements
- **Dynamic field options**: Menu regenerated based on current context depth
- **Depth-based styling**: Elements show increasing border width and different patterns (solid→dashed→dotted)
- **Visual hierarchy**: Badge indicators show depth numbers, colors intensify with depth
- **Breadcrumb navigation**: Clickable path showing "Root → models[0] → spec_groups[1]"
- **Event system**: enterNestedField, navigateToParent, nestedNavigate events

*** Python Integration  
- **Context state management**: NestedSelectionManager tracks current depth and available fields
- **Dynamic field validation**: Field checking based on current context rather than static list
- **Navigation methods**: enter_nested_field(), navigate_to_parent(), navigate_to_depth()
- **Event polling**: check_for_nested_actions() handles JavaScript→Python communication
- **State synchronization**: JavaScript re-injection after context changes

*** Nested Object Hierarchy Support

** User Requirements Fulfilled
✅ **Nested Selection Contexts**: Selecting "models" enters models-specific mode with sub-field options
✅ **Recursive Interface**: Same selection interface reusable at any nesting depth
✅ **Modular Components**: Selection components embedded recursively with proper field definitions
✅ **Visual Depth Indicators**: Border colors, patterns, and badge numbers show selection depth  
✅ **Context Preservation**: Breadcrumb navigation maintains parent selections while navigating sub-selections

** Testing and Demonstration
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_nested_selector.py`) with:
- **Automated demo mode**: Step-by-step demonstration of nested navigation
- **Interactive mode**: Manual exploration with command interface
- **Context information display**: Real-time depth, breadcrumbs, and available fields
- **Hierarchy export**: Complete selection tree export functionality

** Next Steps Prepared
- Architecture ready for production use with hierarchical content extraction
- Test suite available for validation and debugging
- Modular design supports extension to additional nested field types
- Documentation through test command provides clear usage examples

** Session Summary  
Successfully transformed the linear field selection system into a complete hierarchical context system. The implementation provides exactly what was requested: when selecting nested fields like "models", the system opens recursive sub-contexts with appropriate field options, reusing the same selection interface at each depth level with proper visual indicators for selection depth and context navigation.

** Rationale
This implementation addresses the critical gap identified in the handoff - moving from linear field selection to true nested context approach. The modular, recursive design enables handling complex hierarchical data structures while maintaining the familiar selection interface. The visual depth indicators and breadcrumb navigation provide clear user orientation within the nested hierarchy. 

* Turn 3: Cleanup and Handoff Preparation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: [Current Time]
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User requested cleanup and handoff preparation with specific instructions for the next model:
1. Must allow user to test the nested object selection architecture before proceeding
2. After successful testing, expand system to include miscellaneous field that won't be displayed on models page but contains useful information

** Changes Made

*** Cleanup Documentation
- **Created**: `.project_management/cleanup_reports/quantum-horizon_cleanup.org`
  - Complete summary of nested selection architecture implementation
  - Detailed file modifications with line numbers
  - Architecture decisions and technical reasoning
  - Verification results and testing validation
  - Context for next model handoff

*** Next Steps Documentation  
- **Created**: `.project_management/next_steps/quantum-horizon_next_steps.org`
  - Critical priority: User testing requirement before enhancements
  - Phase 1: Mandatory testing approach with multiple test modes
  - Phase 2: Miscellaneous field implementation plan
  - Key files to review and decisions needing user input
  - Complete handoff context and implementation quality summary

*** Session Log Updated
- **Updated**: Current conversation log with Turn 3 documentation

** Rationale

*** User Testing Priority
The user specifically requested testing access, making this the critical first priority for the next model. The nested selection architecture is complete but must be validated by the user before any enhancements proceed.

*** Miscellaneous Field Enhancement Plan
The user wants to add a field that captures useful information but won't be displayed on the models page. This is a straightforward enhancement that builds on the existing architecture but requires testing validation first.

*** Documentation Completeness
Created comprehensive documentation ensuring smooth handoff with clear priorities, technical context, and implementation guidance for the next model.

** Next Steps Identified
1. Next model must prioritize user testing over implementation
2. Multiple testing modes available (demo, interactive, visual)
3. Miscellaneous field enhancement ready for implementation after testing
4. Complete architecture documentation available for reference

** Handoff Message
Will provide handoff message with key priorities and documentation references for seamless transition to next model.
