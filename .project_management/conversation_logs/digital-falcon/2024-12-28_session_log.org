* Turn 1: CORS Error Discovery and Cleanup Protocol Execution
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Current Session
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
User reported a new error in interactive selector functionality - CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy blocking API requests. User requested cleanup protocol execution with documentation of the error and solution approach.

*** CORS Error Analysis
- **Error Type**: "Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/content-extractor/save-configuration/' from origin 'https://www.airscience.com' has been blocked by CORS policy"
- **Root Cause**: Django server lacks CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests
- **Impact**: Interactive selector completely non-functional for saving configurations
- **Architecture**: Error is expected behavior - interactive selector runs ON target websites but needs to call Django API

** Changes Made
*** Cleanup Protocol Execution
- Created `.project_management/cleanup_reports/digital-falcon_cleanup.org` - Comprehensive analysis of CORS issue
- Created `.project_management/next_steps/digital-falcon_next_steps.org` - Detailed solution approach
- Created conversation log directory structure
- No temporary files to archive (previous session files already cleaned up)

*** Documentation Created
- **Cleanup Report**: Complete technical analysis of CORS error, solution approach, security considerations
- **Next Steps**: Step-by-step implementation guide for django-cors-headers configuration
- **Handoff Context**: Clear instructions for next model with time estimates and success criteria

** Rationale
*** Why CORS Configuration is the Solution
1. **Architecture is Correct**: Interactive selector must run on target websites to access DOM
2. **Security Feature, Not Bug**: Browser CORS blocking is proper security behavior
3. **Standard Solution**: django-cors-headers is the established Django solution
4. **No Code Changes Needed**: Previous JavaScript and Python fixes are working correctly

*** Why Cleanup Protocol Was Appropriate
1. **User Request**: Explicit request for cleanup protocol execution  
2. **Critical Issue**: CORS blocking makes entire interactive selector non-functional
3. **Handoff Preparation**: Issue requires Django configuration expertise
4. **Documentation Need**: Complex security issue needs thorough documentation

** Next Steps Identified
*** IMMEDIATE (Critical Blockers)
1. Install django-cors-headers package
2. Configure Django settings.py for CORS
3. Test cross-origin API functionality

*** TECHNICAL APPROACH
- Development: Start with permissive CORS settings for testing
- Production: Lock down to specific allowed origins for security
- Testing: Verify API calls work from actual target websites

*** SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Interactive selector saves configurations without CORS errors
- API calls succeed from target websites to Django server
- End-to-end workflow completes successfully

** Cross-References
- **Cleanup Report**: `.project_management/cleanup_reports/digital-falcon_cleanup.org`
- **Next Steps**: `.project_management/next_steps/digital-falcon_next_steps.org`
- **Previous Session**: Work by Digital Falcon on JavaScript fixes and base URL configuration
- **Architecture**: CORS requirements align with existing cross-origin architecture

** Technical Context
*** Previous Session Accomplishments (Working Correctly)
- Fixed JavaScript circular reference bug
- Implemented configurable base URL system  
- Clarified interactive mode usage
- All Python and JavaScript code functional

*** Current Issue Context
- Backend API endpoints working (verified via direct testing)
- Frontend JavaScript working (verified syntax and logic)
- Integration blocked by browser CORS policy (expected security behavior)
- Solution is Django configuration, not code changes

** Verification Performed
- Analyzed CORS error details from browser console
- Confirmed API endpoints are functional when called from same origin
- Verified that cross-origin architecture is correct and necessary
- Researched django-cors-headers as standard solution
- Documented security considerations for development vs production

** Impact Assessment
*** User Impact
- Interactive selector completely non-functional until CORS configured
- Cannot save field configurations to backend database
- Finish button workflow fails at API call stage

*** Technical Impact  
- No architectural changes needed
- Standard Django configuration task
- Well-documented solution with established best practices
- Estimated 20 minutes for experienced Django developer

*** Security Considerations
- CORS must be configured carefully to avoid vulnerabilities
- Development settings should be more permissive for testing
- Production settings must specify exact allowed origins
- Regular security audits recommended for cross-origin configurations
