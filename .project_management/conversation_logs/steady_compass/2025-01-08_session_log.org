* Turn 1: Taking Over from Crimson Tiger - Related Equipment Test Debug
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 18:05:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - Took over debugging of Related Equipment API test failure
   - User pointed out that Wagtail uses page_ptr_id instead of id field
   - Previous models had identified the root cause: LabEquipmentPageCreateUpdateSerializer missing 'id' field
   - Error was "OperationalError: no such column: base_site_labequipmentpage.id"

** Changes Made
   - First attempt: Added 'id' to LabEquipmentPageCreateUpdateSerializer fields list
   - Second attempt: Added explicit id = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source='pk') to all equipment serializers
   - Modified the exclude statements in get_related_equipment to use pk instead of id

** Rationale
   - Crimson Tiger's analysis was correct - equipment creation was returning None for ID
   - This caused Related Equipment test to fail when trying to access /api/v2/equipment/None/related/
   - User correctly identified that Wagtail pages use page_ptr_id internally, not a direct id column
   - Attempted to resolve by explicitly mapping id field to pk in serializers

** Current Status
   - REGRESSION: First approach (adding 'id' to fields) partially worked but still had 500 error on related endpoint
   - MAJOR REGRESSION: Second approach (explicit id field mapping) broke most API functionality
   - Test results degraded from ~95% pass rate to 61.1% pass rate
   - 7 tests now failing with 500 errors including basic equipment creation and listing

** Next Steps Identified
   - Need to revert the explicit id field mappings that caused regression
   - Try different approach to resolve the Wagtail page_ptr_id issue
   - May need to investigate the database schema to understand the actual column structure
   - Consider using page_ptr_id directly or finding another way to handle Wagtail's ID structure

* Turn 2: User Asked About Related Equipment Purpose
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 18:20:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User asked "what is the related thing supposed to do anyways?"
   - Investigated the get_related_equipment method in views.py
   - Explained the purpose and functionality of the Related Equipment endpoint

** Related Equipment Purpose Identified
   - Recommendation system for lab equipment discovery
   - Finds equipment related by categorized tags (related_by_tags)
   - Finds equipment related by specification groups (related_by_specs)
   - Returns up to 5 items each for cross-selling and research workflows
   - Valuable feature for equipment recommendations and discovery

** Technical Understanding
   - Method uses two separate queries to find related equipment
   - related_by_tags: matches on shared categorized_tags
   - related_by_specs: matches on spec_groups with same names
   - Error likely in the spec_groups__name__in=equipment.spec_group_names query

* Turn 3: Cleanup and Handoff Preparation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 18:25:00
  :END:

** Final Status Summary
   - Successfully reverted from major regression back to 95.2% pass rate
   - 20 out of 21 tests passing, only Related Equipment test failing
   - Root cause confirmed: OperationalError in database query, not serializer issue
   - Equipment creation now properly returns IDs
   - All other API functionality working correctly

** Handoff Documentation Created
   - Created comprehensive cleanup report (.project_management/cleanup_reports/steady_compass_cleanup.org)
   - Created detailed next steps (.project_management/next_steps/steady_compass_next_steps.org)
   - Provided specific debug commands for next model to run
   - Identified exact query that needs investigation

** Key Insights for Next Model
   - Problem is NOT in serializer ID mappings (confirmed working)
   - Problem IS in the ORM query generation for related equipment
   - Focus should be on spec_groups relationship and spec_group_names property
   - All other endpoints work perfectly, so Wagtail page structure is fine elsewhere

* Session Conclusion
** Work Accomplished
   - Identified Related Equipment feature purpose and value
   - Avoided major regression by reverting problematic changes
   - Restored to near-perfect test state (95.2% pass rate)
   - Provided clear debugging path for next model

** Handoff Ready
   - Clean project state with only one failing test
   - Comprehensive documentation for next model
   - Clear understanding of root cause and debugging approach
   - Valuable Related Equipment feature ready to be fixed
