* Turn 1: Enhanced Interactive Selector UI
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:

** Discussion Summary
- Received handoff from Digital Phoenix regarding JavaScript injection issues
- User requested fixes for UI element selectability and selection management menu
- Implemented UI protection mechanisms and selection management interface

** Changes Made
- Modified `apps/content_extractor/selectors/js_injection.py` (lines 545-600, 878-1109):
  - Added UI element protection in `handleElementClick()` function
  - Added `content-extractor-ui` class marking for all injected elements
  - Created `createSelectionManager()` function for selection management
  - Added `removeSelection()`, `clearAllSelections()`, and related functions
  - Enhanced `startSelection()` to show selection manager automatically
  - Updated `stopSelection()` to close selection manager
  - Added unique element IDs to selection data structure

** Rationale
- UI protection prevents users from accidentally selecting interface elements
- Selection management menu provides real-time feedback and deletion capabilities
- Draggable interface improves user experience
- Element tracking allows for better selection management

** Outstanding Issues Identified
1. **UI Selection Protection Incomplete**: Users can still select UI elements despite protection code
2. **Selection Menu Persistence**: Management menu should remain open after selections are made
3. **Code Organization**: JavaScript code embedded in Python needs extraction to separate files
4. **File Cleanup**: Old interactive selector files need removal
5. **Architecture Documentation**: Project architecture file needs updating

** Next Steps Identified
- Debug and fix UI element protection mechanism
- Modify selection workflow to keep management menu open
- Extract JavaScript to separate `.js` files for better maintenance
- Clean up deprecated interactive selector files
- Update `triad_project_architecture.org` with current file structure
