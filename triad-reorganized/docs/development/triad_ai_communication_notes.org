* CURRENT STATUS: AI Collaboration Framework Setup

** What We Just Accomplished
   - Created AI collaboration architecture based on Project OBSQ model
   - Established file organization patterns for AI model interaction
   - Set up directory structure for cleanup reports and conversation tracking
   - Defined communication protocols without project-specific goals

** Current Project Focus
   ⚠️  PROJECT GOALS TO BE DEFINED - User needs to clarify objectives

* Key Context from MDC Files Conversation

** MDC Files Discussion Origin
   - User initially asked about setting up "strict guidelines for models"
   - Wanted architecture file describing file system at all times
   - Requested cleanup reports with specific format and location
   - Asked for "Current Master Goal" document with periodic alignment checks
   - Emphasized balance between "too much" vs "not enough" information

** AI Collaboration System Design
   - Architecture file as single source of truth
   - Current thinking documents stay lean and updated (max 200 lines)
   - Detailed conversation history in separate logs
   - Clean up reports mandatory when requested

** Communication Balance Strategy  
   - THIS FILE: Current decisions and active context
   - CONVERSATION LOGS: Complete historical record  
   - CLEANUP REPORTS: Detailed change documentation

* Established Patterns

** File Organization Philosophy
   - Respect existing Django project structure
   - Add AI collaboration layer without disrupting development
   - Use .project_management/ for AI-specific tracking
   - Maintain separation between code and AI management files

** Naming Conventions Applied
   - Dates: YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Times: HHMMSS format (24-hour)
   - Reports: YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_cleanup_report.org
   - Logs: YYYY-MM-DD_conversation_log.org

* Technology Context Observed

** Django Web Application
   - Python-based development
   - HTML analysis and processing tools
   - Web scraping capabilities
   - Equipment/API-related functionality
   - Active testing and verification scripts

** Key Directories Identified
   - apps/ :: Django applications
   - html_analysis_tools/ :: HTML processing utilities
   - scripts/ :: Utility scripts
   - tests/ :: Test files
   - Multiple comparison output directories

* Next Immediate Steps

** For User
   - Define current master goal for triad-docker-base project
   - Clarify project objectives and success criteria
   - Decide on development priorities

** For Future AI Models
   - Read triad_project_architecture.org FIRST
   - Check current master goal alignment when defined
   - Follow established file patterns
   - Update this file with new current thinking

* Important Context for AI Models

** Project Philosophy
   TO BE DEFINED - awaiting user clarification on project goals

** User Preferences (from Project OBSQ conversation)
   - Likes org-mode for structured information
   - Values clean, consistent organization
   - Wants balance between detail and simplicity
   - Prefers modular approaches
   - Direct and collaborative communication style

** Communication Style
   - Direct and collaborative
   - Values technical precision
   - Appreciates thorough but not verbose explanations
   - Wants to maintain project momentum

* Current File Status
  - triad_project_architecture.org: ✅ Created with Django-aware structure
  - triad_ai_communication_notes.org: ✅ This file - current and active
  - .project_management/ directories: ✅ Created and ready
  - .cursor/rules/ MDC files: ✅ Created with project context
  - Project goals: ⚠️  Awaiting user definition

* IMPORTANT NOTE FOR NEXT AI MODEL

** Remind User About Universal Rules Idea
   The user mentioned an idea about "setting up universal rules for these AI assisted projects" 
   during this conversation. This should be brought up with the user as a potential next step
   for expanding this framework.

** Request Feedback Report
   Future AI models should ask the user for feedback on this AI collaboration framework
   and send back a report covering:
   
*** System Effectiveness Assessment
    - What parts of the architecture are working well
    - What could be improved or streamlined
    - User experience with the communication balance
    - Effectiveness of cleanup reports and handoffs
    
*** Universal Rules Development
    - Whether patterns from this implementation should become standard
    - What core components should be in every AI-assisted project
    - How to balance project-specific needs with universal patterns
    - Scaling considerations for multiple projects

*** Concrete Example Context
    This request comes after successfully implementing AI collaboration frameworks
    across two very different project types:
    - Project OBSQ: Live streaming production system (template-based, OBS integration)
    - Triad Docker Base: Django web application (data processing, HTML analysis)
    
    The patterns proved adaptable and effective across domains, suggesting potential
    for universal application. The user's experience managing this multi-project
    setup provides concrete data for evaluating what should become universal rules.

*** Why This Timing is Important
    - Two different project contexts successfully implemented
    - Real usage experience with the framework patterns
    - Opportunity to learn from cross-project adaptation
    - User has concrete examples to reference for feedback
    - Perfect timing to evolve from project-specific to universal patterns
