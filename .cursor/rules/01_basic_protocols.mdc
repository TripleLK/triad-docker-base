# Basic AI Protocols

## CRITICAL: Turn Completion Marker
Every model response MUST end with: `[SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED MODEL TURN]`

## CRITICAL: Conversation Type Detection
**New Conversation**: If user provides handoff message, cleanup reports, references multiple models, or mentions "handoff"/"transition" → Proceed directly with tasks

**Continuing Conversation**: Check for completion marker in previous response
- Missing marker → Create interruption log marked "**INTERRUPTED - INCOMPLETE TURN**"
- Present marker → Proceed normally

## Code Name Protocol
1. **Establish code name**: Two words (adjective + noun), Xbox gamertag style
2. **Announce clearly** at start of first response
3. **Must be unique** - neither word can reuse previous model components
4. **Update model tracking**: `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org`

### Usage
- Log directories: `conversation_logs/[code-name]/`
- Cleanup reports: `[code-name]_cleanup.org`
- Next steps: `[code-name]_next_steps.org`

@.project_management/model_name_tracking.org
