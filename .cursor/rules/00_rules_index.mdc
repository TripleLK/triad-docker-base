# Cursor Rules Index

## CRITICAL Requirements
All AI models must follow these essential protocols:
- **Turn Completion Marker**: End every response with `[SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED MODEL TURN]`
- **Conversation Logging**: Document ALL actions in daily conversation logs
- **Code Name Protocol**: Establish unique code name for tracking and organization

## Rule Files Overview

### Always Applied Rules
These rules apply to every AI turn regardless of task:

- **01_basic_protocols.mdc** - Turn completion, code names, interruption detection
- **02_conversation_logging.mdc** - Mandatory action logging and documentation
- **04_naming_conventions.mdc** - File naming and documentation standards
- **05_change_management.mdc** - Change approval workflow and requirements

### Conditionally Applied Rules
These rules apply only to specific task types:

- **03_cleanup_protocol.mdc** - Applied when cleanup is requested
- **03_directory_structure.mdc** - Applied for turns involving file creation, movement, directory setup, or project orientation
- **06_django_specific.mdc** - Applied for any tasks that involve django coding
- **07_web_testing_protocols.mdc** - Applied for any turn that will require testing a django server
- **08_rule_maintenance.mdc** - Applied for any turns that involve modifying cursor rules

## Rule Organization Rationale

### Functional Separation
- **Basic Protocols**: Core AI behavior that must be consistent across all interactions
- **Conversation Management**: Documentation and logging requirements for continuity
- **Project Standards**: Naming, change management, and quality requirements  
- **Domain-Specific**: Django development, web testing, directory management
- **System Maintenance**: Rule system integrity and cursor configuration

### Size and Focus
Each rule file focuses on a specific functional area to:
- Improve readability and maintenance
- Reduce cognitive load for models
- Enable conditional application based on task type
- Allow independent updates without affecting other rules

## Tracking and Maintenance
- **rule_application_tracking.org** - Complete rule classification and IDE configuration status
- **08_rule_maintenance.mdc** - Protocols for adding, modifying, and maintaining rules
- All rule changes must update tracking index to prevent orphaned rules
