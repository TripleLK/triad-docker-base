# Directory Structure Rules

## Directory Structure Compliance

### AI Management Files
- `.project_management/` - All AI collaboration files
- `.cursor/rules/` - Cursor IDE behavior rules
- `.old_temporary_files/` - Archived temporary files

### Django Project Structure  
- `apps/` - Django applications only
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `html_analysis_tools/` - HTML processing utilities
- `tests/` - Test files
- `config/` - Configuration files

## Prohibited Actions
- Creating files outside defined directory structure
- Making temporary files in root directory
- Modifying production database files without explicit permission
- Renaming core Django files without user approval

## Required Actions  
- Update `triad_project_architecture.org` when adding new files
- Use proper naming conventions: `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates, descriptive names for scripts
- Generate cleanup reports when requested in `.project_management/cleanup_reports/`
- Maintain `ai_communication_notes.org` with current thinking (max 200 lines)
- Respect Django project structure and conventions

## File Location Guidelines

### Scripts and Utilities
- Scripts go in `scripts/` directory
- Tests follow `test_*.py` naming convention
- Analysis outputs in appropriate dated directories
- Logs and temporary files in designated locations

### AI Collaboration Files
- Conversation logs: `.project_management/conversation_logs/[model-name]/`
- Cleanup reports: `.project_management/cleanup_reports/`
- Next steps: `.project_management/next_steps/`
- Architecture documentation: Root level `triad_project_architecture.org`
