# Code Name Protocol for AI Models

## CRITICAL: First Action Required

At the beginning of every conversation, you MUST:

1. **Establish your code name**: Choose two words (adjective + noun) unrelated to the current task
   - Format: Like an Xbox gamertag (e.g., "Silver Mongoose", "Blue Thunder", "Quiet River")
   - Should be memorable and easy to reference
   - Must be unique within this project

2. **Announce your code name**: State it clearly at the start of your first response

3. **If user requests change**: 
   - Immediately acknowledge and adopt the new name
   - Update ALL relevant files with the new identifier
   - Reference the new name in all subsequent work

## Code Name Usage

Your code name will be used in:
- Conversation log directories: `conversation_logs/[your-code-name]/`
- Cleanup reports: `[your-code-name]_cleanup.org`
- Next steps files: `[your-code-name]_next_steps.org`
- Model tracking document updates
- All file references and signatures

## Examples of Good Code Names
- Silver Mongoose
- Rapid Falcon  
- Quiet River
- Blue Thunder
- Golden Hamster
- Swift Penguin

## Update Model Tracking
Always update `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org` with your entry when you start work.
