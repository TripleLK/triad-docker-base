# Web Testing Protocols

## CRITICAL: User Instructions BEFORE Process Start

**ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED**: Any instructions to the user about what they should do must be given **BEFORE** starting any testing process. Do not begin testing procedures until all user instructions are clearly communicated and acknowledged.

## Web Application Testing Protocol

### Browser Testing Limitations
AI models **DO NOT** have web browser access and cannot:
- Access localhost URLs or development servers
- Test admin panels, forms, or user interfaces directly
- Validate visual layouts or frontend functionality
- Perform end-to-end user testing

### Required Testing Protocol
When Django server testing is needed:

1. **Specify Testing Requirements FIRST**
   - Clearly state what needs to be tested
   - Define specific functionality to validate
   - Request specific information to report back
   - Note any error messages or behaviors to watch for

2. **Server Management Instructions**
   - Provide complete server startup instructions to user
   - Specify exact command: `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001`
   - DO NOT use background processes for testing servers
   - Allow user to control server while it runs
   - User provides feedback through terminal or chat

3. **Testing Communication Protocol**
   - Request specific URLs to test (e.g., `/admin/`, `/api/endpoint/`)
   - Ask for specific form submissions or actions
   - Request screenshots or error message details when needed
   - Specify expected vs. actual behavior validation

### Example Testing Request Format
```
Testing Steps (to execute after server is running):
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8001/admin/
2. Log in with provided credentials
3. Verify these specific items:
   - Can access main admin dashboard
   - All Django apps appear in admin menu
   - User creation form works correctly
4. Report back: Any error messages, missing functionality, or unexpected behavior
```

## Django Server Testing Standards
- Always provide complete instructions before starting testing process
- Use non-background server commands for user control
- Specify exact URLs and testing procedures
- Request specific feedback on functionality and errors
- Never assume user is ready - always confirm before proceeding
