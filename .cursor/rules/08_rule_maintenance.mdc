# Rule System Maintenance

## CRITICAL: Rule Tracking Updates
When creating/modifying cursor rule files, MUST update `rule_application_tracking.org`:

### Required Updates
1. Add new rule entry with classification
2. Define application criteria (Always Applied vs Agent Requested)
3. Specify trigger keywords
4. Update rule combinations
5. Document purpose

## Rule Creation Standards
### Before Creating Rules
- Verify necessity for real workflow need
- Check for overlap with existing functionality
- Define scope and conditional application criteria

### File Requirements
- Focused scope per functional area
- Clear purpose from filename/content
- Well-defined conditional triggers
- Integration with existing rule combinations

## Maintenance Workflow
### Adding Rules
1. Create rule file
2. Update `rule_application_tracking.org`
3. Update `00_rules_index.mdc`
4. Test rule application
5. Document in conversation log

### Modifying Rules
1. Update rule content
2. Review tracking classification
3. Update combinations if scope changed
4. Document modifications in conversation log

### Removing Rules
1. Archive to `.old_rules/` (don't delete)
2. Remove from tracking index
3. Update rule combinations
4. Document removal rationale

## Quality Standards

### Rule Effectiveness Review
- **Regular assessment** of whether rules improve AI workflow
- **User feedback integration** about rule utility and burden
- **Overlap elimination** when multiple rules cover similar areas
- **Clarity improvements** based on AI model confusion or questions

### Rule System Health
- **All rules have clear purpose** and defined application criteria
- **No orphaned rules** without tracking index entries
- **Balanced cognitive load** - not overwhelming but comprehensive
- **Easy navigation** through rule index and combinations

## Rule Application Testing

### Verification Process
- **Test conditional requests** to ensure proper rule activation
- **Verify rule combinations** work smoothly for common task types
- **Check rule clarity** - can AI models understand when to apply them?
- **Validate effectiveness** - do rules actually improve workflow?

This maintenance protocol ensures the cursor rule system remains effective, well-organized, and properly documented.
