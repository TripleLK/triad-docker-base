# Rule System Maintenance

## CRITICAL: Rule Tracking Index Updates

**ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED**: When creating or modifying any cursor rule file, you MUST update the rule application tracking index:

### Required Updates to `rule_application_tracking.org`
1. **Add new rule entry** with complete classification information
2. **Define application criteria** - Always Applied vs Agent Requested  
3. **Specify trigger keywords** - Clear criteria for when rule applies
4. **Update rule combinations** - Add to relevant task-based rule sets
5. **Document purpose and rationale** - Why this rule exists and when it's needed

## Rule Creation Standards

### Before Creating New Rules
- **Verify necessity**: Ensure the rule addresses a real workflow need
- **Check for overlap**: Avoid duplicating existing rule functionality
- **Define scope clearly**: Specify exact situations where rule applies
- **Plan conditional application**: Determine if always applied or agent requested

### Rule File Requirements
- **Focused scope**: Each rule file should cover one functional area
- **Clear purpose**: Obvious from filename and content what the rule addresses
- **Conditional criteria**: Well-defined triggers for when rule should be applied
- **Integration planning**: How rule fits with existing rule combinations

## Rule Maintenance Workflow

### Adding New Rules
1. **Create rule file** with focused scope and clear content
2. **Update `rule_application_tracking.org`** with complete classification
3. **Update `00_rules_index.mdc`** with new rule description
4. **Test rule application** to ensure conditional triggers work
5. **Document in conversation log** with rationale for rule creation

### Modifying Existing Rules
1. **Update rule content** with clear rationale for changes
2. **Review tracking classification** - update if application criteria changed
3. **Update combinations** if rule scope or triggers changed
4. **Document modifications** in conversation log with reasoning

### Removing Obsolete Rules
1. **Archive rule file** rather than deleting (move to `.old_rules/`)
2. **Remove from tracking index** with note about archival
3. **Update rule combinations** to remove references
4. **Document removal rationale** in conversation log

## Quality Standards

### Rule Effectiveness Review
- **Regular assessment** of whether rules improve AI workflow
- **User feedback integration** about rule utility and burden
- **Overlap elimination** when multiple rules cover similar areas
- **Clarity improvements** based on AI model confusion or questions

### Rule System Health
- **All rules have clear purpose** and defined application criteria
- **No orphaned rules** without tracking index entries
- **Balanced cognitive load** - not overwhelming but comprehensive
- **Easy navigation** through rule index and combinations

## Rule Application Testing

### Verification Process
- **Test conditional requests** to ensure proper rule activation
- **Verify rule combinations** work smoothly for common task types
- **Check rule clarity** - can AI models understand when to apply them?
- **Validate effectiveness** - do rules actually improve workflow?

This maintenance protocol ensures the cursor rule system remains effective, well-organized, and properly documented.
