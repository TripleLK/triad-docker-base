* Summary of Changes Made

The Silver Mongoose session established the foundational AI collaboration framework for the Triad Docker Base project. This framework enables consistent handoffs between AI models and maintains project continuity.

Key accomplishments:
- Created active work tracking system
- Established code name protocol for AI model identification
- Implemented conversation logging requirements
- Set up cleanup procedures and file management standards
- Created all necessary directory structures for AI collaboration

* Files Modified/Created/Deleted

** Created Files
   - `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org` - Tracks current project priorities and progress
   - `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org` - Maintains chronological record of AI models
   - `.cursor/rules/01_code_name_protocol.mdc` - Rules for establishing AI model code names
   - `.cursor/rules/02_conversation_logging.mdc` - Requirements for conversation logging
   - `.cursor/rules/03_cleanup_protocol.mdc` - Procedures for cleanup operations
   - `.cursor/rules/04_file_management.mdc` - Standards for file management
   - `.project_management/conversation_logs/silver-mongoose/2025-01-19_session_log.org` - Detailed conversation log
   - `.project_management/cleanup_reports/silver-mongoose_cleanup.org` - This cleanup report
   - `.project_management/next_steps/silver-mongoose_next_steps.org` - Next steps document

** Modified Files
   None

** Deleted Files
   None

** Archived Files
   None - No temporary files were created during this session that required archiving.

* Reasoning for Each Change

** AI Collaboration Framework
   The framework was established to address the user's concern about inconsistent handoffs between AI models. By creating structured documentation and standard procedures, future models will have clear guidelines for maintaining continuity.

** Active Work Tracking
   This file serves as the central hub for tracking project progress and priorities. It establishes the primary objective (restructuring the Wagtail website) and defines success criteria.

** Model Name Tracking
   The tracking document creates accountability by recording which AI models worked on what aspects of the project. This addresses the user's concern about models taking work in "an entirely other direction" during handoffs.

** MDC Rule Files
   Split into four separate files to maintain clarity and focus:
   1. Code name protocol - Creates consistent identification system
   2. Conversation logging - Ensures detailed records for reference
   3. Cleanup protocol - Standardizes end-of-session procedures
   4. File management - Maintains organizational consistency

** Conversation Logging
   Implemented detailed logging to preserve context between AI model handoffs, as requested by the user who wanted "extensive chat recaps available."

* Updated Architecture

** New Directory Structure

   ```

** Pattern Establishment
   - Code names follow the adjective-noun pattern (e.g., Silver Mongoose)
   - Org files use consistent headers and metadata
   - MDC files provide behavior instructions for AI models
   - Cross-referencing between files ensures traceability

* Potential Issues or Warnings

** Framework Testing Needed
   The collaboration framework has been established but not yet tested with a handoff to a new AI model. Its effectiveness can only be fully evaluated after multiple handoffs.

** Project Architecture Updates Required
   The `triad_project_architecture.org` file needs updating to reflect the new AI collaboration framework and current master goal.

** Temporary File Handling
   The structure for archiving temporary files has been established but not tested, as no temporary files were created in this session.

* Verification Steps Completed

** Directory Structure Verification
   - Confirmed creation of all required directories
   - Verified correct placement of all files
   - Ensured proper naming conventions

** Documentation Completeness
   - Verified all files have proper headers and metadata
   - Confirmed cross-references between related files
   - Checked for consistent formatting and organization

** Framework Functionality
   - Confirmed MDC rule files contain required instructions
   - Verified conversation log structure follows protocol
   - Ensured cleanup and next steps procedures are documented

* Conversation Context References

** Relevant Conversation Logs
   - `.project_management/conversation_logs/silver-mongoose/2025-01-19_session_log.org`
     This log contains the complete conversation about establishing the AI collaboration framework, including user preferences and requirements.

** Key Decisions from Conversation
   1. Established code name protocol for AI model identification
   2. Created structured conversation logging system
   3. Implemented cleanup protocol with reporting requirements
   4. Set up file management standards with documentation requirements
   5. Prioritized restructuring the Wagtail website as the primary objective
