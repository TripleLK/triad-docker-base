* Session Overview

** Session Objective
Enhance cursor rules for better AI collaboration and continue Electric Shark's file organization work

** Sessions Completed
- Primary focus: Cursor rules enhancement and restructuring
- Secondary focus: Conditional rule application system design

* Work Completed

** Rule System Enhancements

*** Turn 1: Conversation Logging Enhancement
- **Modified** `.cursor/rules/02_conversation_logging.mdc` - Enhanced conversation logging protocol
  * Added explicit "MANDATORY LOGGING AFTER EVERY MODEL ACTION" language
  * Implemented Step 1/Step 2 interruption recovery format
  * Made logging interrupted turns the "ABSOLUTE FIRST ACTION"
  * Added "NO EXCEPTIONS" language for absolute clarity

*** Turn 2: Rule System Restructuring and Turn Completion Marker
- **Created** `.cursor/rules/01_basic_protocols.mdc` - Turn completion marker, code names, interruption detection
- **Created** `.cursor/rules/00_rules_index.mdc` - Navigation guide for new rule structure
- **Created** `.cursor/rules/03_directory_structure.mdc` - Directory compliance and file location rules
- **Created** `.cursor/rules/04_naming_conventions.mdc` - File naming and documentation standards
- **Created** `.cursor/rules/05_change_management.mdc` - Autonomous vs discussion-required changes
- **Created** `.cursor/rules/06_django_specific.mdc` - Django project context and protection rules
- **Created** `.cursor/rules/07_testing_protocols.mdc` - Web testing limitations and protocols
- **Deleted** old consolidated files that were broken into focused components

*** Turn 3: Conditional Rule Application System
- **Created** `.project_management/next_steps/crimson-phoenix_next_steps.org` - Comprehensive handoff document
- **Created** `.cursor/rules/rule_application_tracking.org` - Conditional rule application system
- **Created** `.cursor/rules/08_rule_maintenance.mdc` - Rule system maintenance protocols

*** Turn 4: Rule Application Adjustments
- **Modified** `.cursor/rules/rule_application_tracking.org` - Streamlined for IDE directive focus
  * Removed unnecessary sections for IDE-managed features
  * Changed timing from session-based to turn-based application
  * Converted to "IDE Directive" format for user configuration

*** Turn 5: Final Rule Updates and Cleanup
- **Modified** `.cursor/rules/07_web_testing_protocols.mdc` - Updated testing rules
  * Added requirement for user instructions BEFORE starting testing processes
  * Focused specifically on web testing protocols
  * Enhanced example testing request format
- **Modified** `.cursor/rules/rule_application_tracking.org` - Updated with actual IDE inclusion criteria
- **Modified** `.cursor/rules/00_rules_index.mdc` - Updated with actual triggers and renamed testing file

** System Maintenance
- **Updated** `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org` - Added Crimson Phoenix entry, marked Electric Shark complete
- **Created** comprehensive conversation logs tracking all work completed

* Major Deliverables

** Enhanced Cursor Rules System
- **Automatic interruption detection** via mandatory turn completion markers
- **Conditional rule application** reducing cognitive load while maintaining effectiveness
- **Restructured rule files** into 8 focused, maintainable components
- **Clear IDE directives** for conditional rule application configuration

** Rule Classification System
- **Always Applied Rules**: Basic protocols, conversation logging, naming conventions, change management
- **Agent Requested Rules**: Cleanup, directory structure, Django-specific, web testing, rule maintenance
- **Turn-based application** rather than session-wide for better flexibility

** Documentation and Tracking
- **Rule application tracking** with complete classification and IDE status
- **Rule maintenance protocols** preventing orphaned rules
- **Next steps preservation** maintaining context from Electric Shark's work
