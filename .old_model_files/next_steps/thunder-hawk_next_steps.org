* Immediate Priorities

** Priority 1: Comprehensive Functionality Testing
Phase A reorganization moved ALL files - critical to verify no functionality was broken:

### Django Functionality Verification
- **Execute**: `cd triad-reorganized && python manage.py check --settings=config.settings.dev`
- **Test**: Django development server startup and admin panel access
- **Verify**: All apps load correctly and database connectivity functions
- **Validate**: Import paths for all Django apps and configurations

### Script and Tool Functionality Testing
- **Test**: All moved scripts in `triad-reorganized/scripts/` subdirectories
- **Verify**: Equipment scrapers, data import tools, and analysis scripts function correctly
- **Check**: Import dependencies and path references after reorganization
- **Validate**: Git automation script still functions from new location

### Frontend and Client Testing
- **Test**: Client application in `triad-reorganized/client/` 
- **Verify**: Node.js dependencies and build processes
- **Check**: Static file serving and media file access
- **Validate**: Frontend-backend integration after reorganization

** Priority 2: Layout Validation and Unnecessary File Removal
Ensure logical organization and clean up any remaining unnecessary files:

### Systematic Layout Review
- **Review**: Each subdirectory in triad-reorganized for logical categorization
- **Identify**: Any misplaced files or inconsistent organization patterns
- **Validate**: Archive system properly separates development artifacts from active files
- **Confirm**: Script organization by functional purpose is maintained

### Unnecessary File Identification and Removal
- **Scan**: Archive directories for truly obsolete files that can be deleted
- **Review**: Development testing artifacts for relevance and necessity
- **Clean**: Any remaining cache files, temporary build artifacts, or duplicate configurations
- **Document**: Removal decisions and rationale for future reference

** Priority 3: Phase B Execution - Bulk Move Back to Root
After testing confirms functionality, execute the bulk consolidation:

### Pre-Phase B Preparation
- **Backup**: Create comprehensive backup or git tag before bulk move
- **Plan**: Strategy for moving all triad-reorganized contents back to root
- **Prepare**: Script or systematic approach for bulk file movement
- **Document**: Phase B execution plan with rollback strategy

### Phase B Execution Strategy
- **Move**: All contents from triad-reorganized/ back to root while preserving organization
- **Update**: Any import paths or references that need root-level adjustment
- **Verify**: Django functionality after bulk move completion
- **Clean**: Remove empty triad-reorganized directory after successful move

** Priority 4: Project Layout Documentation and Rule Creation
Identify and enhance project layout standards:

### Project Layout Documentation Discovery
- **Search**: For existing project structure documentation
- **Review**: `triad-reorganized/docs/` for architecture or layout specifications
- **Check**: README files for structure explanations or conventions
- **Identify**: Any established patterns or standards for file organization

### Rule Creation for Project Layout Respect
- **Create**: Cursor rule about respecting existing project layout documentation
- **Specify**: Requirements for checking layout standards before making changes
- **Document**: Process for validating structural changes against project conventions
- **Integrate**: Layout respect requirements into change management protocols

* Essential Context from Thunder Hawk's Work

** Phase A Reorganization Achievement
- **Complete success**: ALL project files moved into triad-reorganized/ structure
- **Functional categorization**: Scripts by purpose, data by type, archives by status
- **Preserved functionality**: Django integrity maintained through systematic verification
- **Clean root separation**: Only AI infrastructure and organized project remain at root

** Enhanced AI Collaboration Framework
- **Git automation integration**: Mandatory final step prevents work loss during handoffs
- **Active work tracking requirements**: Ensures focused, coordinated development approach
- **Comprehensive documentation**: All changes tracked with clear rationale and cross-references

** Current Project State Excellence
- **Organized structure**: triad-reorganized/ contains complete functional Django project
- **Infrastructure separation**: .git/, .project_management/, .cursor/ provide AI collaboration support
- **Documentation current**: All file movements tracked and cross-referenced
- **Git history comprehensive**: Complete change tracking with proper model attribution

* Recommended Approach for Testing and Validation

** Systematic Testing Methodology
1. **Django core testing**: Start with basic Django functionality to ensure foundation is solid
2. **Import path validation**: Test all custom apps and script imports systematically
3. **Script functionality**: Verify each tool category works in new organized locations
4. **Integration testing**: Confirm frontend-backend and external tool integration

** Documentation and Standards Review
1. **Comprehensive search**: Look for any existing project layout documentation
2. **Pattern identification**: Document discovered organizational principles
3. **Rule development**: Create cursor rules for respecting established layout standards
4. **Integration planning**: Align Phase B execution with documented layout principles

* Decision Points for Next Model

** Testing Scope and Depth
- **Conservative approach**: Comprehensive testing of all functionality before Phase B
- **Targeted approach**: Focus testing on critical path functionality only
- **Risk tolerance**: How thoroughly to test before proceeding with bulk move

** Phase B Timing and Strategy
- **Immediate execution**: Proceed with bulk move after basic functionality verification
- **Delayed execution**: Wait for comprehensive testing and cleanup completion
- **Incremental approach**: Move file categories systematically rather than bulk operation

** Project Layout Standards
- **Discovery priority**: How extensively to search for existing layout documentation
- **Rule creation scope**: Comprehensive layout rules vs basic respect requirements
- **Documentation level**: How detailed to make project structure documentation

* Resources and References

** Key Files for Review and Testing
- **Django configuration**: `triad-reorganized/config/` - settings and main configuration
- **Core applications**: `triad-reorganized/apps/` - all Django apps and functionality
- **Script tools**: `triad-reorganized/scripts/` - organized by functional category
- **Documentation**: `triad-reorganized/docs/` - project documentation and architecture

** Testing Tools and Commands
- **Django testing**: `python manage.py check --settings=config.settings.dev`
- **Development server**: `python manage.py runserver --settings=config.settings.dev`
- **Script testing**: Execute tools from appropriate triad-reorganized subdirectories
- **Import testing**: Python import verification for all moved modules

** Current Organization Structure
- **Frontend**: `triad-reorganized/client/` - React/JS application
- **Configuration**: `triad-reorganized/config/` - Django settings and environments
