* Immediate Priorities

** Priority 1: Commit File Organization Changes
File organization is complete and ready for git automation:

### Use Git Automation Script
- **Execute**: `python triad-reorganized/scripts/git_cleanup_push.py` (remove --dry-run flag)
- **Result**: Will commit and push ~56 file changes to ai-work branch
- **Benefit**: Preserves all file organization work with proper attribution

### Verify Commit Success
- **Check**: Ensure all file movements are committed and pushed to remote
- **Validate**: Confirm ai-work branch has comprehensive file organization changes
- **Document**: Update conversation logs with commit completion

** Priority 2: Update Project Architecture Documentation
Critical documentation update needed after major reorganization:

### Update triad_project_architecture.org
- **Add**: New triad-reorganized directory structure documentation
- **Update**: File location references that changed during reorganization
- **Document**: Archive system and categorization logic
- **Cross-reference**: Link to git history for file movement tracking

### Validate Architecture Accuracy
- **Review**: Ensure all documented file locations are current
- **Test**: Verify import paths and script references in documentation
- **Update**: Any outdated references to old file locations

** Priority 3: Consider Remaining Root Directory Organization
Assess whether additional organization is beneficial:

### Evaluate Remaining Directories
- **client/**: Determine if frontend code should be integrated into triad-reorganized
- **envs/**: Consider if environment configurations need organization
- **tests/**: Evaluate if test structure should be consolidated with triad-reorganized/tests/
- **static/**, **media/**: Assess Django asset organization needs

### Directory Consolidation Decision
- **Analyze**: Whether remaining directories serve essential Django functions
- **Plan**: Integration strategy if consolidation would be beneficial
- **Preserve**: Django project structure integrity during any changes

* Essential Context from Stellar Raven's Work

** File Organization Completion Achieved
- **Root directory cleanup**: 40+ files/directories successfully organized
- **Functional categorization**: Scripts by purpose, data by type, archives by status
- **System integrity**: Django functionality verified working after reorganization
- **Archive system**: Complete with proper historical preservation

** Established Organization Patterns
- **Scripts organization**: 
  * `/equipment_scrapers/` - CSS selectors, scrapers, analysis tools
  * `/data_import/` - Migration, processing, and database management
  * `/analysis/` - HTML analysis tools and demonstration scripts
  * `/tools/` - Environment switching and utility scripts
- **Data organization**:
  * `/reference/` - Configuration files, URL lists, checkpoints
  * `/sample_payloads/` and `/selectors/` - Working data files
- **Archive organization**:
  * `/development_testing/` - Jupyter notebooks, HTML fixtures, debug files
  * `/temporary_files/` - Historical temp directories and briefings
- **Documentation organization**:
  * `/api/` - Tool usage and API documentation
  * `/development/` - Planning documents and briefings
  * `/equipment_integration/` - Scraper documentation and templates

** System Verification Completed
- **Django check**: `python manage.py check --settings=config.settings.dev` - PASSED
- **Git automation**: `git_cleanup_push.py --dry-run` shows 56 files ready for commit
- **Import functionality**: All moved scripts maintain working import paths
- **Directory structure**: All subdirectories created and properly organized

** Git Workflow Ready
- **Branch**: Currently on ai-work with established model attribution pattern
- **Changes detected**: Git automation shows comprehensive file organization changes
- **Script tested**: git_cleanup_push.py verified working from correct git root
- **Attribution pattern**: "[Description] by [Model Name]" commit format established

* Recommended Approach for Architecture Documentation

** Follow Established Documentation Patterns
1. **Update existing sections**: Modify triad_project_architecture.org to reflect new structure
2. **Add triad-reorganized section**: Document the complete organized structure
3. **Cross-reference**: Link file movements to conversation logs for context
4. **Maintain accuracy**: Ensure all file references reflect new locations

** Testing and Validation Strategy
1. **Documentation accuracy**: Verify all referenced files exist at documented locations
2. **Import path testing**: Ensure documentation includes correct paths for script execution
3. **Git history**: Use git log to verify file movements are properly tracked
4. **Link validation**: Test that cross-references and file paths are accessible

* Decision Points for Next Model

** Git Commit Timing
- **Immediate commit**: Execute git automation to preserve file organization work
- **Delayed commit**: Wait for additional work to batch commits (not recommended)
- **Verification level**: How thoroughly to test before committing changes

** Architecture Documentation Scope
- **Comprehensive update**: Complete documentation overhaul reflecting new structure
- **Incremental update**: Focus only on changed file locations
- **Detail level**: How granular to make the directory structure documentation

** Additional Organization Scope
- **Conservative approach**: Keep remaining root directories as-is for Django integrity
- **Complete consolidation**: Consider moving all auxiliary directories to triad-reorganized
- **Hybrid approach**: Organize some directories while preserving essential Django structure

* Resources and References

** Key Files for Review
- **File organization results**: Current root directory contains only essential Django files
- **Git automation**: `triad-reorganized/scripts/git_cleanup_push.py` ready for execution
- **Architecture doc**: `triad_project_architecture.org` needs update with new structure
- **Previous work**: Review electric-shark_next_steps.org for original organization plan

** Tools Available
- **Git automation**: Tested and ready git workflow with model attribution
- **Django verification**: Confirmed working configuration for testing changes
- **Directory structure**: Complete triad-reorganized framework with proper categorization
- **Documentation templates**: Established patterns in conversation logs and cleanup reports

** Current Branch Status  
- **Working branch**: ai-work with 3 commits from previous models
- **Remote status**: Available for continued collaborative work
- **Change volume**: ~56 files ready for commit showing comprehensive organization
- **Attribution ready**: Commit pattern established for tracking model contributions

* Success Criteria

** Git Workflow Completion
- All file organization changes committed and pushed to ai-work branch
- Git history shows clear tracking of file movements with proper attribution
- Remote repository reflects current organized state for team collaboration

** Architecture Documentation Update
- triad_project_architecture.org accurately reflects new file organization
- All file location references updated to reflect triad-reorganized structure
- Documentation includes rationale for organization decisions and archive system

** System Integration Verification
- Django functionality remains verified working after any additional changes
- All script import paths documented and functional
- Project maintains development efficiency with improved organization

The foundation is excellent - file organization is complete and system integrity verified. Next model should commit these changes and update documentation to reflect the new organized structure while considering any remaining consolidation opportunities.
