* Immediate Priorities

** 1. Test AI Collaboration Framework
   - Have a new AI model use the established framework
   - Verify it correctly identifies itself with a code name
   - Confirm it properly logs conversations
   - Test the cleanup protocol functionality

** 2. Update Project Architecture Document
   - Modify `triad_project_architecture.org` to reflect new AI collaboration framework
   - Update the Current Master Goal section with restructuring objectives
   - Include the new directory structure and file organization
   - Document the relationships between framework components

** 3. Begin File Inventory Assessment
   - Create inventory of all project files with purpose and relationships
   - Identify temporary/analysis files that could be archived
   - Flag unnecessary files for potential removal
   - Categorize files by function and importance

** 4. Analyze Django App Structure
   - Review the current app organization
   - Document dependencies between apps
   - Identify areas for consolidation or separation
   - Develop proposal for improved structure

* Recommended Approach

** For Testing Framework (Priority 1)
   1. Start a new conversation with a different AI model
   2. Do not explicitly tell it about the framework
   3. See if it reads the MDC files and follows protocols
   4. Note any gaps or confusion in the instructions
   5. Refine the MDC files based on observed behavior

** For Architecture Document (Priority 2)
   1. Review existing architecture document thoroughly
   2. Create draft updates in a temporary file
   3. Maintain the existing format and structure
   4. Add new sections for AI collaboration framework
   5. Update file references to reflect current state

** For File Inventory (Priority 3)
   1. Focus first on root directory files
   2. Then examine the comparison output directories
   3. Document the HTML analysis tools functionality
   4. Create a prioritized list of cleanup candidates
   5. Consider a standard naming convention for output directories

** For Django App Analysis (Priority 4)
   1. Start with the `apps/` directory structure
   2. Examine each app's purpose and components
   3. Review imports to identify dependencies
   4. Consider logical groupings based on functionality
   5. Create visualization of app relationships

* Decision Points for User

** Framework Questions
   1. Is the level of detail in the conversation logs appropriate?
   2. Are there additional cleanup steps you'd like to include?
   3. Should the framework enforce specific docstring formats for code?
   4. Do you want to add rules about when to create new branches?

** Architecture Questions
   1. How should we prioritize the restructuring efforts?
   2. Are there specific Django apps that should be preserved as-is?
   3. What level of testing is required during restructuring?
   4. Are there performance concerns to address during restructuring?

** Process Questions
   1. Would you prefer we tackle the cleanup in stages or all at once?
   2. Should we focus on documentation improvements first or code restructuring?
   3. How should we handle potentially breaking changes during restructuring?
   4. What is the priority for implementing documentation standards?

* Handoff Information

** Current State
   - AI collaboration framework established and ready for testing
   - Initial project analysis completed with focus on restructuring needs
   - Directory structure created for framework components
   - MDC rules defined for consistent AI behavior

** What Was Left Intentionally Incomplete
   - Detailed file inventory (requires systematic review)
   - Django app restructuring proposal (requires deeper analysis)
   - Project architecture document updates (depends on user feedback)
   - Archive directory setup (placeholder only)
