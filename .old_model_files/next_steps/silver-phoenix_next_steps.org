* CRITICAL PRIORITY: README.md Complete Rewrite

** Immediate Action Required
The current `triad-reorganized/README.md` is **completely obsolete** and describes old directory structures, scripts, and workflows that no longer exist after the Phase A reorganization. This is a **critical blocker** that must be addressed before any further development.

### Current README Problems
- **Obsolete directory references**: References `envs/`, `apps/shared/`, `lllk-wagtail-base/` that don't match current structure
- **Non-existent scripts**: Documents `run.sh`, `switch_env.sh`, `create_db.sh` that aren't in current organization
- **Wrong structure description**: Shows old wagtail-docker-base structure completely different from triad-reorganized/
- **Outdated instructions**: All setup and usage instructions incorrect for current project state

### Required README Rewrite Scope
- **Document current structure**: Reflect actual triad-reorganized/ directory organization
- **Update setup instructions**: Accurate environment setup for current Django configuration  
- **Correct script references**: Document actual scripts in `scripts/` subdirectories
- **Reflect reorganization**: Explain the organized structure with functional categorization
- **Accurate usage**: Update all commands and instructions for current file locations

* Immediate Priorities

** Priority 1: Documentation Foundation (CRITICAL)
Complete README.md rewrite is essential before any other work:

### README.md Rewrite Requirements
- **Structure Documentation**: Document actual triad-reorganized/ directory structure
  * `apps/` - Django applications (ai_processing, base_site, categorized_tags, etc.)
  * `config/` - Django configuration with environments in `config/environments/`
  * `scripts/` - Organized by function (equipment_scrapers, data_import, analysis, tools)
  * `docs/` - Documentation (api, development, equipment_integration)
  * `data/` - Reference data and sample payloads
  * `archive/` - Development artifacts and historical files
  * `analysis_outputs/` - Analysis results (archived, current)

- **Setup Instructions**: Update for current Django configuration
  * Environment configuration location: `config/environments/`
  * Django settings: `config.settings.dev` and `config.settings.prod`
  * Database setup: Reflect actual db.sqlite3 location and create_admin.py usage
  * Requirements: Update for actual requirements.txt location

- **Script Documentation**: Document actual script categories and usage
  * Equipment scrapers: `scripts/equipment_scrapers/` with selector files and analysis tools
  * Data import: `scripts/data_import/` with migration and processing tools
  * Analysis tools: `scripts/analysis/` with HTML analysis and demonstration scripts
  * Utilities: `scripts/tools/` and main `scripts/git_cleanup_push.py`

- **Development Workflow**: Document current project workflow
  * AI collaboration framework with `.project_management/` and `.cursor/rules/`
  * Git automation with `scripts/git_cleanup_push.py`
  * Archive system for development artifacts vs active files

** Priority 2: Phase B Execution Decision
After documentation is current, decide on Phase B timing:

### Phase B Considerations
- **Current state**: All functionality validated within triad-reorganized/ structure
- **Documentation dependency**: Should complete README before bulk move to avoid confusion
- **User preference**: Confirm whether to execute Phase B bulk move back to root
- **Testing requirements**: Any additional validation needed before bulk move

### Phase B Execution Plan (if chosen)
- **Backup strategy**: Create git tag or comprehensive backup before bulk move
- **Move methodology**: Systematic approach to move all triad-reorganized/ contents to root
- **Path updates**: Update any remaining import paths or script references for root-level structure
- **Final validation**: Confirm Django functionality after bulk move completion

** Priority 3: Layout Documentation Rules
Create cursor rule for project structure respect:

### Rule Creation Requirements  
- **Structure validation**: Rule requiring checks against current project layout before changes
- **Documentation compliance**: Ensure changes align with documented organization patterns
- **Architecture updates**: Requirements for updating documentation when structure changes
- **Change approval**: Process for validating structural modifications against established standards

** Priority 4: Frontend Application Testing (Conditional)
If Phase B is executed, validate frontend integration:

### Client Application Testing
- **React/JS functionality**: Test `client/` application builds and serves correctly
- **Backend integration**: Verify frontend-backend communication after structural changes  
- **Static file serving**: Confirm CSS, JS, and media files accessible from frontend
- **Development workflow**: Ensure Node.js dependencies and build processes functional

* Essential Context from Silver Phoenix's Work

** Phase A Validation Success
- **Django functionality**: 100% confirmed working within triad-reorganized/ structure
- **Testing complete**: System checks, deployment checks, admin panel, web server all functional
- **Import paths**: All Django apps and configurations load correctly without issues
- **User validation**: Web server functionality confirmed by user testing

** Clean Project Structure Achieved
- **Unnecessary files removed**: Cache files, debug artifacts, and system files eliminated
- **Logical organization**: Archive system properly separating development vs active files
- **Database integrity**: Both database versions preserved (confirmed different content)
- **Functional categorization**: Scripts, data, docs organized by purpose from Thunder Hawk's work

** Documentation Assessment Complete
- **Obsolete README identified**: Current version completely out of sync with project structure  
- **Architecture foundation**: Comprehensive documentation exists in `triad_project_architecture.org`
- **Established standards**: Naming conventions and directory rules documented in cursor rules
- **Update requirements**: Clear scope defined for README rewrite and architecture updates

* Current Project State Excellence

** Validated Organization Structure
- **triad-reorganized/**: Complete functional Django project with organized subdirectories
- **Root separation**: Only `.git/`, `.project_management/`, `.cursor/`, `triad-reorganized/` at root
- **Functional categorization**: Scripts by purpose, data by type, archives by development status
- **Enhanced AI framework**: Git automation, active work tracking, comprehensive documentation

** Ready for Next Development Phase
- **Phase A complete**: All files systematically organized with validated functionality
- **Testing validated**: Django core functionality confirmed working in reorganized structure
- **Cleanup complete**: Unnecessary files removed while preserving all essential content
- **Documentation scoped**: Clear requirements for README rewrite and structure updates

* Recommended Approach for Next Model

** Start with README Rewrite (CRITICAL)
1. **Analyze current structure**: Review actual triad-reorganized/ organization thoroughly
2. **Document accurately**: Create comprehensive README reflecting current state
3. **Update instructions**: Ensure all setup and usage instructions work with current structure
4. **Test documentation**: Verify all documented commands and paths are correct

** Consider Phase B Timing
1. **Documentation first**: Complete README before considering bulk move
2. **User consultation**: Confirm Phase B execution preference and timing
3. **Backup preparation**: Create comprehensive backup strategy before bulk move
4. **Validation planning**: Define post-Phase B testing requirements

* Decision Points for Next Model

** Documentation Scope and Detail
- **Comprehensive rewrite**: Complete README overhaul vs incremental updates
- **Technical depth**: How detailed to make the structure and script documentation
- **User audience**: Balance developer technical details with general project usage

** Phase B Execution Strategy
- **Immediate execution**: Proceed with bulk move after README completion
- **Delayed execution**: Focus on documentation and rule creation first
- **User preference**: Confirm actual preference for Phase B timing and approach

** Development Priorities
- **Documentation focus**: Prioritize current, accurate documentation over new features
- **Structure stability**: Maintain current organization vs further optimization
- **Rule creation**: How comprehensive to make project layout compliance rules

* Resources and References

** Key Files for README Documentation
- **Current structure**: `triad-reorganized/` - actual directory organization to document
- **Django configuration**: `triad-reorganized/config/` - settings and environment configuration
- **Script organization**: `triad-reorganized/scripts/` - functional categorization to document
- **Documentation assets**: `triad-reorganized/docs/` - existing documentation to reference

** Architecture Documentation Assets
- **Architecture file**: `triad-reorganized/docs/triad_project_architecture.org` - comprehensive architecture
- **Cursor rules**: `.cursor/rules/` - established naming conventions and directory standards
- **Active work tracking**: `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org` - project objectives and progress

** Testing and Validation Tools
- **Django commands**: System checks, deployment checks, development server startup
- **Script testing**: Execute tools from organized script directories
- **Import validation**: Python import verification for all relocated modules

* Success Criteria

** README Documentation Complete
- Accurate documentation of current triad-reorganized/ structure and organization
- Updated setup instructions that work with current Django configuration
- Correct script references reflecting actual organized script categories
- Clear development workflow documentation including AI collaboration framework

** Phase B Decision and Execution
- Informed decision on Phase B timing with user consultation and backup strategy
- If executed: successful bulk move with preserved functionality and organization
- Updated documentation reflecting final project structure
- Validated Django and frontend functionality after any structural changes

** Project Layout Standards Established
- Cursor rule created for respecting documented project structure
- Change management integration with layout validation requirements  
- Architecture documentation updated to reflect current organization
- Future development aligned with established organizational principles

The foundation is excellent - Phase A validation complete with Django functionality confirmed and project structure cleaned. Next model should prioritize README rewrite as critical blocker, then proceed with Phase B decision and layout documentation standards.
