* Immediate Priorities

** 1. Resolve Django Settings Configuration Issue
   - Investigate why create_admin.py still fails despite correcting settings path
   - Check for environment variables that may be set to old paths
   - Search all configuration files for references to "apps.base_site.settings"
   - Test admin panel access once issue is resolved

** 2. Complete File Organization Structure
   - Create additional organized subdirectories in triad-reorganized/
   - Implement scripts/, tests/, docs/, data/, analysis_outputs/ structure
   - Begin systematic consolidation of scattered files
   - Archive temporary analysis output directories

** 3. Test Reorganized Structure Functionality
   - Verify all Django apps work correctly in new structure
   - Test web scraping functionality
   - Validate API endpoints
   - Confirm database operations

* Recommended Approach

** For Django Settings Issue (Priority 1)
   1. Check current environment variables: `echo $DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`
   2. Search for hardcoded references: `grep -r "apps.base_site.settings" triad-reorganized/`
   3. Examine manage.py and wsgi.py for settings references
   4. Check if any Django apps have settings imports in their __init__.py files
   5. Test with fresh environment after fixing all references

** For File Organization (Priority 2)
   1. Create the missing directory structure in triad-reorganized/
   2. Start with consolidating scripts from root directory
   3. Move test files to organized tests/ structure
   4. Archive comparison output directories to analysis_outputs/archived/
   5. Create documentation for new organization

** For Functionality Testing (Priority 3)
   1. Start development server and verify basic functionality
   2. Test admin panel after resolving settings issue
   3. Run existing test suites to ensure nothing broke
   4. Test API endpoints and web scraping features
   5. Validate equipment integration functionality

* Decision Points for User

** File Organization Questions
   1. Should we be aggressive about archiving old analysis outputs?
   2. Are there specific scripts that should stay in root directory?
   3. What level of testing is required before replacing original structure?
   4. Should we maintain backward compatibility during transition?

** Django Configuration Questions
   1. Are there production considerations for the settings issue?
   2. Should we update all scripts to use the new settings path?
   3. Do we need to maintain environment variable compatibility?
   4. What's the timeline for completing the reorganization?

** Development Process Questions
   1. Should we work entirely in triad-reorganized/ or continue copying?
   2. How should we handle the transition from old to new structure?
   3. Are there specific integration tests we should run?
   4. What documentation updates are needed?

* Handoff Information

** Current State
   - Basic Django structure successfully reorganized and tested
   - Core functionality verified (development server, system checks)
   - Django settings configuration issue identified but not fully resolved
   - AI collaboration framework enhanced with cutoff recovery
   - Detailed documentation of all changes maintained

** What Was Left Intentionally Incomplete
   - Additional directory structure creation (scripts/, tests/, docs/, data/)
   - File consolidation from root directory (many scattered files remain)
   - Analysis output archival (6+ comparison directories to organize)
   - Comprehensive functionality testing of reorganized structure

** Work Left Incomplete Due to Interruption
   - Complete diagnosis of Django settings import issue
   - Environment variable investigation
   - Testing of admin panel functionality
   - Resolution of create_admin.py script

** Resources for Next AI Model
   - `.project_management/conversation_logs/rapid-falcon/2025-01-19_session_log.org` - Complete session history
   - `.project_management/cleanup_reports/rapid-falcon_cleanup.org` - Detailed change documentation
   - `triad-reorganized/` - Working reorganized structure ready for enhancement
   - `.project_management/active_work_tracking.org` - Master goal and progress tracking

** Reference Materials to Review
   - `triad_project_architecture.org` - Original architecture documentation
   - `config/settings/` - Django configuration files
   - Root directory file inventory (see conversation log Turn 1)
   - Silver Mongoose's file reorganization proposal

* Specific Commands for Next Model

** Django Settings Investigation
   ```bash
   cd triad-reorganized
   echo $DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
   grep -r "apps.base_site.settings" .
   python manage.py shell --settings=config.settings.dev
   ```

** File Organization Commands
   ```bash
   cd triad-reorganized
   mkdir -p {scripts/{equipment_scrapers,data_import,analysis},tests/{unit,integration,fixtures},docs/{api,deployment,equipment_integration},data/{selectors,sample_payloads,reference},analysis_outputs/{archived,current}}
   ```

** Testing Commands
   ```bash
   cd triad-reorganized
   python manage.py check
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001
   python create_admin.py
   ```

* Files Ready for Organization

** Root Directory Scripts (Ready to Move)
   - `verify_api_page.py` → `scripts/equipment_scrapers/`
   - `test_api_client_direct.py` → `tests/integration/`
   - `test_lab_equipment_api.py` → `tests/integration/`
   - `test_specs.py` → `tests/unit/`
   - `test_triad_selectors.py` → `tests/unit/`
   - `get_token.py` → `scripts/data_import/`
   - `fix_html.py` → `scripts/analysis/`
   - `check_*.py` files → `scripts/analysis/`

** Data Files (Ready to Move)
   - `adam_equipment_selectors.json` → `data/selectors/`
   - `equipment_payload.json` → `data/sample_payloads/`
   - `triad_checkpoint.json` → `data/reference/`
   - `triad_url_queue.json` → `data/reference/`
   - `test_*.json` files → `tests/fixtures/`

** Analysis Outputs (Ready to Archive)
   - `comparison_output_20250604_130330/` → `analysis_outputs/archived/`
   - `comparison_test_20250604_122846/` → `analysis_outputs/archived/`
   - `airscience_*_comparison_*/` → `analysis_outputs/archived/`
