* Immediate Priorities

** 1. Archive Historical Model Files (CRITICAL FIRST TASK)
   **BEFORE starting new sub project work**, archive all model files before "Quiet Echo":

*** Models to Archive (14 total):
    1. Silver Mongoose
    2. Rapid Falcon
    3. Swift Penguin
    4. Electric Shark
    5. Crimson Phoenix
    6. Stellar Raven
    7. Thunder Hawk
    8. Silver Phoenix
    9. Crimson Forge
    10. Quantum Gecko
    11. Noble Harbor
    12. Crimson Tiger
    13. Ancient Storm
    14. Quiet Forge

*** Archive Structure to Create:
    ```
    .old_model_files/
    ├── conversation_logs/
    │   ├── silver-mongoose/
    │   ├── rapid-falcon/
    │   ├── [etc...]
    │   └── quiet-forge/
    ├── cleanup_reports/
    │   ├── silver-mongoose_cleanup.org
    │   ├── rapid-falcon_cleanup.org
    │   ├── [etc...]
    │   └── quiet-forge_cleanup.org
    └── next_steps/
        ├── silver-mongoose_next_steps.org
        ├── rapid-falcon_next_steps.org
        ├── [etc...]
        └── quiet-forge_next_steps.org
    ```

*** Files to Move:
    - **Conversation Logs**: All directories in `.project_management/conversation_logs/` for the 14 models
    - **Cleanup Reports**: All files in `.project_management/cleanup_reports/` for the 14 models
    - **Next Steps**: All files in `.project_management/next_steps/` for the 14 models

*** Files to PRESERVE (Do NOT Archive):
    - Keep "Quiet Echo" and any subsequent models in their current locations
    - Maintain `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org` (update but don't archive)
    - Keep all cursor rules files (they've been streamlined and are current)

** 2. New Sub Project Setup
   After archiving is complete, focus on new sub project infrastructure:
   - Clean workspace ready for fresh development
   - Utilize streamlined cursor rules for optimal performance
   - Follow established project layout compliance rules

* Recommended Approach

** Archive Process
   1. Create `.old_model_files/` directory structure
   2. Move files systematically by model (oldest to newest)
   3. Verify all files moved correctly
   4. Update references in documentation if needed
   5. Test that current workspace is clean and functional

** Verification Steps
   - Confirm historical files are preserved in archive
   - Verify current working directories only contain active models
   - Check that cursor rules and tracking systems still function
   - Validate project layout compliance

* Decision Points for User

** Archive Scope Confirmation
   - Confirm the 14 models listed should be archived
   - Verify "Quiet Echo" should be the earliest preserved model
   - Clarify if any specific historical files should remain accessible

** New Sub Project Direction
   - What type of sub project will be implemented?
   - Any specific requirements for the new development phase?
   - Should additional setup or configuration be done?

* Handoff Information

** Current State
   - Cursor rules system fully streamlined and operational
   - Model tracking system up to date
   - Clean codebase ready for new development
   - Historical context preserved but needs archiving

** What Was Completed
   - Complete overhaul of cursor rules (60% size reduction)
   - All essential protocols maintained
   - Enhanced model performance optimization
   - Comprehensive documentation of changes

** Resources for Continuation
   - Streamlined cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/`
   - Complete cleanup report: `.project_management/cleanup_reports/quiet_forge_cleanup.org`
   - Model tracking: `.project_management/model_name_tracking.org`
   - All essential project infrastructure intact

** Critical Context
   The cursor rules have been significantly streamlined to improve model performance. The next model should benefit from reduced cognitive load while maintaining all essential protocols and requirements.
