* Immediate Priorities

** Priority 1: Complete File Organization (Continuation)
- **Remaining root directory files**: ~15 files still need organization
- **Django app files**: Review and organize any Django-specific files that haven't been moved
- **Configuration files**: Ensure config files are properly categorized in triad-reorganized structure
- **Documentation files**: README, requirements.txt, and any markdown files need proper placement

** Priority 2: Verify Import Dependencies
- **Check moved script imports**: Verify that moved Python files don't have broken import statements
- **Django integration**: Ensure Django can still locate moved utilities if referenced in settings/apps
- **Test import paths**: Run basic import tests on reorganized Python files
- **Update any hardcoded paths**: Look for scripts that might reference old file locations

** Priority 3: Complete Archive System
- **Review remaining analysis outputs**: Several output directories may still be in root
- **Archive old temporary files**: Look for any remaining temp files or outdated artifacts
- **Verify archive organization**: Ensure archived files are properly categorized and documented

* Recommended Approach

** File Organization Strategy
1. **List remaining root files**: Use `ls -la` to see what's left to organize
2. **Categorize by function**: Group remaining files by purpose (config, docs, Django, etc.)
3. **Follow established patterns**: Use the directory structure already created in triad-reorganized
4. **Preserve Django structure**: Don't move core Django files (manage.py, etc.) unless explicitly needed

** Testing and Validation
1. **Import verification**: Test import statements on moved Python files
2. **Django functionality**: Ensure Django can still run after file movements
3. **Script execution**: Test that moved scripts can still execute from new locations
4. **Documentation updates**: Update any README or docs that reference old file paths

** Git Integration
1. **Use established git script**: The `scripts/git_cleanup_push.py` is ready for use
2. **Commit incrementally**: Make smaller commits for easier tracking of remaining work
3. **Branch awareness**: Continue using ai-work branch for organized pushes

* Decision Points for User

** Scope of Organization
- **Should ALL root files be moved?** Some files (like .gitignore, requirements.txt) might be intentionally in root
- **Django app reorganization**: Should Django apps be reorganized within the triad-reorganized structure or kept separate?
- **Legacy file handling**: Should very old analysis outputs be deleted rather than archived?

** Development Priorities  
- **Focus on organization vs new features?** Complete file organization first or start developing new functionality?
- **Testing approach**: Should we create real unit tests for existing scripts during organization?
- **Documentation priority**: How much documentation should be created during organization vs later?

* Handoff Information

** Current State of Work
- **Major structure complete**: Directory framework and organization patterns established
- **Git workflow operational**: Script tested and working for future AI sessions
- **High-priority files organized**: Scripts, data files, and development testing properly categorized
- **Archive system established**: Clear separation between current work and historical artifacts

** What Was Left Intentionally Incomplete
- **Root directory cleanup**: ~15 files remaining for next phase of organization
- **Import dependency verification**: Moved files may need import path updates
- **Complete archive review**: Some analysis outputs may still need categorization
- **Documentation updates**: File references in docs may need updating after movements

** Resources and References for Continuation

*** Essential Files to Review First
- **Swift Penguin's roadmap**: `.project_management/next_steps/swift-penguin_next_steps.org`
- **Current session log**: `.project_management/conversation_logs/electric-shark/2025-01-19_session_log.org`  
- **Project architecture**: `triad_project_architecture.org` for overall structure understanding

*** Key Tools Available
- **Git automation**: `scripts/git_cleanup_push.py` - ready for immediate use
- **Directory structure**: `triad-reorganized/` with organized subdirectories
- **File tracking**: All movements documented in cleanup report and session log

*** Current Branch Status
- **Working branch**: `ai-work` with 2 commits from Electric Shark
- **Remote status**: Successfully pushed and available for continued work
- **Commit pattern**: "[Description] by [Model Name]" for clear attribution

** Estimated Work Remaining
- **File organization**: 2-3 hours to complete remaining root directory cleanup
- **Import verification**: 1-2 hours to test and fix any broken dependencies  
- **Archive completion**: 1 hour to finish categorizing remaining outputs
- **Documentation updates**: 1-2 hours to update file references

** Success Criteria for Next Phase
- Root directory contains only essential Django files and project-level configs
- All reorganized files maintain functional import statements and execution capability
- Archive system is complete with all historical artifacts properly categorized
- Documentation accurately reflects new file organization structure

The foundation is solid - next AI model should focus on completing the systematic organization while preserving all functional capabilities.
