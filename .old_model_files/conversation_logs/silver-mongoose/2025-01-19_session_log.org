** Discussion Summary
   - Established Silver Mongoose as code name for this AI model instance
   - User requested creation of active work tracking file and .mdc rule files
   - Discussed framework for AI collaboration with focus on handoff management
   - Set up protocols for code naming, conversation logging, and cleanup procedures
   - User explained project context: Wagtail website for medical equipment reseller with scope creep issues

** Changes Made
   - Created .project_management/active_work_tracking.org - Central tracking for current work and priorities
   - Created .project_management/model_name_tracking.org - Chronological record of AI models working on project
   - Created .cursor/rules/01_code_name_protocol.mdc - MDC rule for establishing model code names
   - Created .cursor/rules/02_conversation_logging.mdc - MDC rule for mandatory conversation logging
   - Created .cursor/rules/03_cleanup_protocol.mdc - MDC rule for cleanup procedures
   - Created .cursor/rules/04_file_management.mdc - MDC rule for file management standards
   - Created .project_management/conversation_logs/silver-mongoose/2025-01-19_session_log.org - This log file

** Rationale
   - Active work tracking enables clear project focus and progress monitoring
   - Model name tracking creates accountability and historical context for AI contributions
   - MDC rule files provide persistent instructions that will guide all future AI models
   - Conversation logging ensures continuity between AI model handoffs
   - Cleanup protocol creates standardized way to archive work and document status
   - File management standards prevent disorganization and maintain Django project integrity

** Next Steps Identified
   - Begin file inventory assessment to identify cleanup candidates
   - Start analyzing Django app structure for reorganization opportunities
   - Test MDC rule functionality with new AI model instances
   - Continue developing cleanup and handoff procedures based on usage

** Key Insights from Session
   - Project has significant scope creep requiring focused cleanup effort
   - HTML analysis tools appear to be core functionality
   - Multiple temporary/analysis output directories suggest need for better organization
   - Equipment/API integration is important feature to preserve during restructuring

** Framework Status
   - ✅ Code name protocol established
   - ✅ Conversation logging system operational
   - ✅ Cleanup procedures documented
   - ✅ File management standards defined
   - ⏳ Ready for testing with future AI model handoffs

* Turn 2: Cleanup Execution
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: Final Session
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - User requested cleanup with the command "clean up!"
   - Executed the cleanup protocol as defined in the MDC rules
   - Created cleanup report and next steps documents
   - Updated active work tracking with completed tasks

** Changes Made
   - Created .project_management/cleanup_reports/silver-mongoose_cleanup.org - Detailed report of all changes
   - Created .project_management/next_steps/silver-mongoose_next_steps.org - Guidance for next AI model
   - Updated .project_management/active_work_tracking.org - Marked completed tasks and changed status

** Rationale
   - Cleanup report provides comprehensive documentation of work completed
   - Next steps document ensures smooth handoff to the next AI model
   - Active work tracking updates maintain accurate project status

   - Links to: .project_management/next_steps/silver-mongoose_next_steps.org
   - Updates to: .project_management/active_work_tracking.org

** Framework Status
   - ✅ First complete cycle of framework tested (setup to cleanup)
   - ✅ Cleanup protocol executed successfully
   - ✅ Handoff documentation prepared for next AI model
   - ✅ Phase 1 (Framework Setup) completed
