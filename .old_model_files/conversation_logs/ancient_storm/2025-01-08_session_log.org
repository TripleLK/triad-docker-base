* Turn 1: Debugging Related Equipment API Test
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 19:30:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - Received handoff from Steady Compass
   - Project at 95.2% test pass rate (20/21 tests passing)
   - Only Related Equipment API test failing with OperationalError: no such column: base_site_labequipmentpage.id
   - User suggested making and running migrations
   - Identified that Wagtail Page models use page_ptr_id instead of id as primary key

** Changes Made
   - Updated .project_management/model_name_tracking.org - Added Ancient Storm entry
   - Modified apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py:115 - Changed LabEquipmentPageListSerializer to use 'page_ptr_id' instead of 'id'
   - Modified apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py:149 - Changed LabEquipmentPageDetailSerializer to use 'page_ptr_id' instead of 'id'
   - Modified apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py:193 - Changed LabEquipmentPageCreateUpdateSerializer to use 'page_ptr_id' instead of 'id'
   - Modified apps/lab_equipment_api/views.py:418-424 - Changed .exclude(pk=equipment.pk) to .exclude(page_ptr_id=equipment.page_ptr_id)
   - Modified apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py:358 - Updated BulkEquipmentUpdateSerializer to use 'page_ptr_id' instead of 'id'
   - Modified test_lab_equipment_api_complete.py:213 - Changed test to extract 'page_ptr_id' instead of 'id' from API responses
   - Modified test_lab_equipment_api_complete.py:220 - Updated bulk operations to use 'page_ptr_id' in created_pages tracking
   - Modified test_lab_equipment_api_complete.py:318-327 - Updated bulk update test to use 'page_ptr_id' in update data structure
   - Ran makemigrations and migrate commands (no new migrations needed)

** Rationale
   - The error indicated Django was looking for an 'id' column on base_site_labequipmentpage table
   - LabEquipmentPage inherits from Wagtail's Page model which uses page_ptr_id as primary key
   - All serializers and API operations needed to be updated to use page_ptr_id consistently
   - Test needed updating to work with the new field name
   - Database migrations were checked to ensure schema was up to date

** Testing Results
   - Verified individual query works in Django shell: LabEquipmentPage.objects.filter(...).exclude(page_ptr_id=...)
   - Verified serialization works in isolation with LabEquipmentPageListSerializer
   - Test still shows 95.2% pass rate with Related Equipment test failing with same error
   - Error persists despite all obvious 'id' references being changed to 'page_ptr_id'

** Next Steps Identified
   - Need to investigate if the error comes from a different source
   - May need to check for 'id' references in related models or Django internals
   - Consider if the error occurs in a different code path than expected
   - Investigate if there are cached queries or other sources of the 'id' reference

** Cross-References
   - Connected to Steady Compass handoff documentation
   - Relates to original test suite development by Noble Harbor
   - Part of broader API completion objective
