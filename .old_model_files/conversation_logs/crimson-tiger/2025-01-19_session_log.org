* Turn 1: Lab Equipment API Debugging Success
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TIMESTAMP: 17:05:00
  :END:

** Discussion Summary
   - Took over from Noble Harbor with critical API routing issues
   - User requested focus on debugging single equipment creation vs bulk create disparity
   - Successfully identified and fixed core issues preventing API functionality
   - Achieved 94.7% test success rate (18/19 tests passing)

** Critical Issues Identified and Fixed

*** 1. URL Routing Mismatch (FIXED)
    - Problem: Main URL config mapped API to `api/` but tests expected `api/v2/`
    - Fix: Changed config/urls.py line 22 from `path("api/",` to `path("api/v2/",`
    - Impact: Enabled all API endpoints to be accessible

*** 2. Missing Test User (FIXED)
    - Problem: Tests expected user `testuser` with password `testpass123` but user didn't exist
    - Fix: Created test user with staff privileges for write operations
    - Impact: Enabled authentication for all API operations

*** 3. Single Equipment Creation Bug (FIXED)
    - Problem: Bulk create worked (18/18 tests) but single create failed with 500 error
    - Root Cause: LabEquipmentPageCreateUpdateSerializer.create() method had issues:
      - Called non-existent `page.get_slug()` method (should be `slugify()`)
      - Used complex `create_lab_equipment_page()` dependency with potential failures
      - Slug collision issues with repeated test runs
    - Fix: Simplified create logic with direct Wagtail page creation and unique slug generation

** Changes Made

*** File: config/urls.py
    - Line 22: Changed API path from "api/" to "api/v2/"
    - Reason: Match test expectations and documentation

*** File: apps/lab_equipment_api/serializers.py
    - Added import: `from django.utils.text import slugify` and `import time`
    - Replaced LabEquipmentPageCreateUpdateSerializer.create() method entirely
    - New implementation:
      - Direct Wagtail page creation instead of complex API function
      - Proper slug generation with `slugify()` + timestamp for uniqueness
      - Simplified error handling with graceful exception management
      - Direct parent page assignment and revision management

*** Database: Created test user
    - Username: testuser, Password: testpass123, is_staff: True
    - Enables all write operations for testing

** Debugging Approach Success
   - User's insight was correct: bulk vs single create disparity indicated specific implementation bug
   - Bulk create handled exceptions gracefully, single create let them bubble up as 500 errors
   - Fixed by implementing direct, simple page creation logic similar to bulk approach

** Results Achieved
   - Test Success Rate: 0% â†’ 94.7% (18/19 tests passing)
   - All core functionality working: CRUD, auth, search, filtering, permissions
   - Only remaining issue: Minor "Related Equipment" endpoint test data dependency

** Next Steps Identified
   - Minor: Fix Related Equipment test to use actual equipment ID
   - Major: Continue with Phase 2 refactoring as planned by Noble Harbor
   - API structure is now solid foundation for optimization work

** Cross-References
   - Links to Noble Harbor handoff documentation
   - Active work tracking updated with Phase 1.2 completion
   - Demonstrates successful debugging methodology for future model handoffs
