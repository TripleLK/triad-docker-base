# Implementation Plan for Triad Scientific Scraper

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for developing the triadscientific.com scraper, based on the website structure analysis completed in Step 1.

## Overall Approach

We'll follow a modular approach similar to the AirScience scraper, with separate YAML selectors for different parts of the extraction process. The implementation will proceed in these stages:

1. URL discovery (categories, subcategories, products)
2. Product information extraction
3. Integration with Django models
4. Categorization and tagging

## YAML Selectors to Develop

Based on our analysis, we'll need to create the following YAML selector files:

### URL Discovery
- `categories.yaml`: Extract main category URLs
- `subcategories.yaml`: Extract subcategory URLs from category pages
- `product_urls.yaml`: Extract product detail page URLs from subcategory pages
- `pagination.yaml`: Handle pagination on listing pages (if present)

### Product Information Extraction
- `name.yaml`: Extract product name/title
- `short_description.yaml`: Extract product summary description
- `full_description.yaml`: Extract detailed product description
- `imgs.yaml`: Extract product images
- `specs_groups.yaml`: Extract technical specifications
- `models.yaml`: Extract information about product variants/models (if present)
- `category_tags.yaml`: Extract category information for tagging

### Integration
- `mapping.yaml`: The main mapping file that references all component extractors

## Development Sequence

1. First, develop and test the URL discovery selectors to ensure we can navigate through all levels of the site
2. Next, develop the product information extractors, testing on sample product pages
3. Create the mapping selector to combine all extractors
4. Develop the management command for scraping
5. Implement data import functionality
6. Add categorization and tagging

## Testing Strategy

Throughout development, we'll test each selector individually before integrating:

1. Test URL discovery on various sections of the site
2. Test product information extraction on products from different categories
3. Perform full integration testing on a limited set of products
4. Validate the complete scraper with broader coverage

## Management Command Structure

We'll create a new Django management command (`import_triadscientific.py`) with options for:
- Scraping specific categories
- Limiting number of products
- Dry run mode
- Update or create mode
- Verbosity control

## Data Mapping Strategy

The extracted data will be mapped to Django models as follows:
- Product information → `LabEquipmentPage`
- Product variants → `EquipmentModel`
- Specifications → `SpecGroup` and `Spec`
- Images → `LabEquipmentGalleryImage`
- Categories → `TagCategory` and `CategorizedTag`

## Technical Considerations

- Handle various HTML structures across different product categories
- Implement error recovery for failed extractions
- Add rate limiting to avoid overloading the website
- Create detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Ensure proper image downloading and processing

## Timeline Estimates

- URL Discovery Selectors: 1-2 days
- Product Information Selectors: 2-3 days
- Integration and Mapping: 1-2 days
- Management Command: 1-2 days
- Testing and Refinement: 2-3 days

Total estimated development time: 7-12 days

## Next Actions

1. Begin implementing URL discovery selectors
2. Test URL discovery process on the live website
3. Proceed with product information extractors
4. Continue updating documentation as the implementation progresses
