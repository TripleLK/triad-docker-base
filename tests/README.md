# Django Ninja API v3 Test Suite

Created by: Thunder Wave  
Date: 2025-01-08  
Project: Triad Docker Base

## Overview

Comprehensive test suite for the Django Ninja API v3 migration from DRF v2, covering all endpoints and functionality.

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
- **`test_django_ninja_api.py`** - Complete unit test coverage for all API endpoints

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
- **`test_api_workflows.py`** - End-to-end workflow testing

### Test Runner (`tests/test_runner.py`)
- Custom test runner with API-specific configurations

## API Endpoints Tested

### System Endpoints
- `GET /api/v3/health` - Health check with database connectivity
- `GET /api/v3/test` - Basic functionality verification

### Equipment Endpoints  
- `GET /api/v3/equipment` - List equipment with pagination
- `GET /api/v3/equipment/{id}` - Equipment detail view
- `GET /api/v3/equipment/{id}/related` - Related equipment by tags/specs

### Supporting Endpoints
- `GET /api/v3/models` - Equipment models with filtering
- `GET /api/v3/tags` - Categorized tags with category filtering

## Test Categories

### Functional Testing
- **SystemEndpointsTest** - Health check and test endpoints
- **EquipmentEndpointsTest** - Equipment listing, detail, and related equipment
- **ModelsEndpointsTest** - Equipment models functionality
- **TagsEndpointsTest** - Categorized tags functionality

### Quality Assurance
- **APIErrorHandlingTest** - Error handling and edge cases
- **WagtailCompatibilityTest** - Wagtail Page inheritance compatibility
- **APIPerformanceTest** - Query efficiency and performance
- **APIDocumentationTest** - Schema generation and documentation

### Integration Testing
- **APIWorkflowIntegrationTest** - Complete user workflows
- Error handling across multiple requests
- Pagination workflows

## Running Tests

### All Tests
```bash
python manage.py test tests --settings=config.settings.development
```

### Unit Tests Only
```bash
python manage.py test tests.unit --settings=config.settings.development
```

### Integration Tests Only
```bash
python manage.py test tests.integration --settings=config.settings.development
```

### Using Custom Test Runner
```bash
python tests/test_runner.py --all
python tests/test_runner.py --unit
python tests/test_runner.py --integration
```

## Key Testing Features

### Wagtail Compatibility
- Tests proper page_ptr_id aliasing to id field
- Validates backwards query patterns for related equipment
- Ensures Wagtail Page inheritance works with Django Ninja

### Performance Testing
- Query count assertions to prevent N+1 problems
- Response time monitoring for performance regression detection
- Concurrent request handling verification

### Error Handling
- Invalid parameter handling
- Non-existent resource responses
- Database error graceful degradation
- Malformed request handling

### Real-World Scenarios
- Complete equipment discovery workflows
- Tag-based equipment relationships
- Pagination across different endpoints
- Multi-step API interactions

## Test Data Setup

Tests use realistic equipment data including:
- Multiple equipment pieces with different configurations
- Tag relationships across categories (technique, application, feature)
- Equipment models and accessories
- User authentication tokens

## Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to:
- Run in isolated test database environments
- Handle database migrations automatically
- Provide clear failure messages for debugging
- Support parallel test execution

## Coverage Goals

- **100% endpoint coverage** - All API endpoints tested
- **Error path coverage** - All error conditions tested  
- **Integration coverage** - All user workflows tested
- **Performance coverage** - All endpoints performance tested

## Maintenance

- Update tests when API endpoints change
- Add new test cases for new functionality
- Monitor test performance and optimize as needed
- Keep test data realistic and representative
